<p>Opus 4.5 has a much higher <em>volume</em> of rework (1,861 vs 207 overlaps), but the key quality signal is the user-directed correction rate: 256 instances vs just 4. When controlled for task complexity, the user correction rate is significantly higher across all bins for Opus 4.5, while self-correction and error recovery rates are comparable.</p>
