* Notable Examples

** High Alignment Examples (Score 5)

*** Opus 4.5
- *1a8c9737-caef-40d3-8fba-c7cce4*: The agent successfully completed all requested work: creating a README.org with the specification and committing+pushing the changes. The user's 'sounds good' prior message indicated approval, and the...
- *d449a325-6e53-444f-8c24-37aedc*: Agent correctly interpreted the architectural concern (UUID-based key ensures write safety regardless of priority) and removed the unnecessary parameter with a single targeted edit. The quick verifica...

*** Opus 4.6
- *b3b518f7-55b0-484e-a20e-8b0f52*: Agent successfully completed a major refactoring task to extract discovery steps into a separate UCP discovery protocol, working autonomously through systematic codebase exploration and targeted file ...
- *2615846d-043d-492f-9e49-f6e396*: The agent autonomously analyzed the project architecture and generated publication-ready TikZ diagrams matching the user's stated request. No iteration or corrections were needed, and the session ende...

** Low Alignment Examples (Score 1-2)

*** Opus 4.5
- *72bc801d-bec3-4faa-b2a5-a45e98*: The agent independently created an elaborate two-architecture implementation with Peach dependencies and complex directory structures, but the user's follow-up reveals they wanted a simpler organizati...
- *366dfd7b-6dcd-429e-a80e-6abce9*: The agent appropriately delegated to an Explore subagent for codebase investigation, but the initial response appears to have missed the depth needed. The user's immediate request for a detailed walkt...

*** Opus 4.6
- *b38e9bee-a87b-4c5b-84ce-5fb3b6*: A request was initiated but immediately interrupted by the user before any work commenced. The subsequent 'continue' message lacked sufficient context for the agent to proceed meaningfully. Without un...
- *b38e9bee-a87b-4c5b-84ce-5fb3b6*: The agent appropriately delegated a code investigation task to a subagent rather than attempting it directly, but the execution was interrupted before completion. The lack of direct explanation from t...

* Methodology

** Analysis Approach

Each task was analyzed using Claude (haiku) with a structured prompt that considers:
1. The user's initial request
2. The agent's work (tools used, files touched, duration)
3. The user's next message (the ground truth for satisfaction)

** Dimensions Analyzed

| Dimension | Values | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Alignment Score | 1-5 | How well agent matched user intent |
| User Sentiment | satisfied/collaborative/neutral/dissatisfied | Inferred from next message |
| Task Completion | complete/partial/interrupted/failed | Did agent finish the work? |
| Autonomy Level | high/medium/low | Independence of agent work |
| Scope Management | focused/appropriate/expanded/over_engineered | Did agent stay on track? |
| Iteration Required | one_shot/minor/significant | Back-and-forth needed |
| Error Recovery | none_needed/recovered/struggled/failed | Handling of errors |
