  "summary": "The agent executed a complex multi-part initialization task involving project setup, requirement analysis, and architecture planning for a Flutter + Cloudflare MVP. While the breadth of work was appropriate to the request, the 12 edit errors and high iteration count suggest execution challenges, and the subsequent user direction to 'setup firebase and shorebird' implies the prior work, though useful, didn't fully deliver the operational readiness the user ultimately needed.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User expects the agent to proceed with Firebase and Shorebird configuration/setup as a discrete task, moving from planning/scaffolding to active tool integration.",
