  "summary": "The agent successfully explored the SDK structure and provided a systematic code walkthrough, but the follow-up indicates the user wanted more focused analysis on the unstable_v2 APIs specifically. While the execution was competent and well-structured, it appears the initial response didn't adequately address what the user was most interested in learning about, requiring a deeper follow-up investigation to properly answer their underlying question about undocumented API features.",
