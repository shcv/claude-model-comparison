The user provided a detailed implementation plan for a Peach event system but the session log shows zero tool calls and zero file modifications, indicating the agent never received clear direction to begin execution. The plan document itself appears incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence), suggesting the user message may have been truncated or interrupted during submission.",
