  "summary": "The agent successfully diagnosed a test expectation failure through systematic file examination, but failed to proceed with the implied fix after diagnosis. The user's follow-up 'fix the expectation' suggests they expected a more proactive agent that would implement solutions, not just report problems. This represents a misalignment between investigative rigor (executed well) and expected autonomy (insufficient).",
