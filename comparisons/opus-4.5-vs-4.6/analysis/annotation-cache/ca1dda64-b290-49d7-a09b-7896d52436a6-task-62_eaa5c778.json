The user's follow-up questions suggest they wanted investigation and potential configuration changes, but the agent's response didn't clearly address the core concern about the agent becoming unresponsive, leading to continued uncertainty about the issue's nature and resolution.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User shifted focus to ask about debug logging features, transcript recording, and interrupt sensitivity configuration - indicating they want to understand and potentially fix the root cause rather than just report the issue.",
