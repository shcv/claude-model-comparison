It created a detailed plan document outlining the refactoring approach to unify these systems while respecting their different requirements, demonstrating good alignment with the user's intent to avoid previous mistakes. The work was well-organized and clearly communicated, though execution was intentionally deferred pending user approval of the plan.",
