  "summary": "Agent successfully implemented a multi-component RSS/Gnus scoring system using Claude API subagents, demonstrating strong technical execution with good error recovery. The work matched the user's intent well (complex multi-part system with batch processing and scoring), though the single-word 'continue' follow-up suggests there's more to implement or refine. The user appears ready to proceed with additional development rather than being satisfied with a complete product.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User said 'continue', indicating they want the agent to proceed with next phases of the feature. This could mean extending functionality, debugging existing code, or implementation of remaining components.",
