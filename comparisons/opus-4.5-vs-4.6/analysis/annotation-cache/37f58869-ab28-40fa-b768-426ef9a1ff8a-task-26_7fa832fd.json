The execution was largely autonomous and on-target, though some editing friction occurred. The user's pivot to new issues suggests satisfaction with the fix but indicates there are deeper tracking problems (Kindle/Reading) and UX improvements needed, requiring continued iteration.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User pivoted to two new issues: (1) Kindle app not tracking Reading category time despite foreground/background events, and (2) request to display per-app usage on activity details page. This is typical feature iteration following a bug fix.",
