{
  "user_sentiment": "neutral to slightly impatient - the user asked a direct follow-up question ('yes, remove it') that implies expectation of action",
  "sentiment_confidence": "medium",
  "execution_quality": "The agent efficiently researched the KVL issue through grep searches and file inspection, but did not execute the removal despite the user's explicit follow-up request to 'remove it'.",
  "work_category": "Investigative code review to understand usage of a specific component (KVL) and identify where it needs to be removed from the codebase.",
  "scope_management": "focused - agent stayed on the investigation task but didn't transition to execution",
  "communication_quality": "adequate - the agent explained findings clearly during investigation but may have failed to communicate why the removal step wasn't taken",
  "error_recovery": "none_needed - no errors encountered, but the agent may have needed clarification or authorization that it didn't explicitly seek",
  "iteration_required": "significant - the user had to provide a second explicit instruction to remove KVL",
  "task_completion": "partial - investigation was completed, but the removal action requested in the follow-up message was not executed",
  "alignment_score": 2,
  "summary": "The agent successfully investigated the KVL issue and confirmed it's unused, but failed to execute the explicit removal instruction that followed. This represents a gap between information gathering (completed well) and action execution (not attempted), requiring the user to reiterate their request.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user likely expected the agent to proceed with removing KVL references after confirming removal was desired, but instead would need to ask again or receive a response about why removal wasn't completed.",
  "autonomy_level": "medium - the agent independently investigated the codebase but halted at the decision point rather than executing the requested removal",
