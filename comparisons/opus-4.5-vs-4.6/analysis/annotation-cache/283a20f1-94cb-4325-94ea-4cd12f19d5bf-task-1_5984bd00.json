  "user_sentiment": "Thoughtful refinement with technical correction. The user's follow-up clarifies that 'type' and other elements are tags (a more unified conceptual model), and provides additional reasoning about where 'key' would/wouldn't appear based on that model.",

  "summary": "The agent appropriately investigated the grammar by locating and reading the relevant files, but the investigation appears to have been primarily observational rather than leading to concrete conclusions or proposals about supporting the requested syntax variations. The user's follow-up suggests they've further refined their own thinking about the design (realizing 'type' is just another tag), indicating the agent may have missed an opportunity to synthesize findings or propose implementation approaches. More iteration is expected.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "Normal iterative refinement of requirements. The user is clarifying the conceptual model (unified 'tags' rather than separate type/key concepts) and constraining the grammar design space accordingly. This suggests the agent should now re-examine the grammar with this mental model in mind.",
