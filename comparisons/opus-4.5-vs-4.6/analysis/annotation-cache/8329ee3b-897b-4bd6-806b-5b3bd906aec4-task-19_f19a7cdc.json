However, the work remained exploratory without producing clear, actionable solutions to the user's core problem.",

  "summary": "The agent performed competent technical research into firmware downgrade procedures but delivered exploratory findings rather than solving the user's core problem of file validity or identifying viable intermediate versions. The follow-up question reveals the user still needs clearer guidance on procedural sequencing and network configuration preservation, indicating the prior work provided context but not sufficient actionable direction.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is asking clarifying questions about the upgrade/downgrade process timeline and whether IP configuration is preserved across downgrades. This indicates they're planning their approach based on the agent's findings and need more specific technical guidance about the procedure's mechanics.",
