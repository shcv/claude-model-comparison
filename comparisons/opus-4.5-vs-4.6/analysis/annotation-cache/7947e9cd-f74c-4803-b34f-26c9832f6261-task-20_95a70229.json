  "summary": "The agent independently executed a migration task with multiple iterations and error recovery, completing 16 bash operations across 174 seconds. However, the user's immediate pivot to a different question suggests misalignment with their actual intent\u2014they may have been seeking guidance on migration strategy rather than automatic execution, or the migration outcome didn't meet their needs. The shift in topic indicates either satisfaction or a desire to explore alternative approaches.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User moved to a different concern (screenshot storage) rather than confirming migration success, suggesting either the migration was complete but the user had other priorities, or the user was looking for validation that better approaches existed.",
