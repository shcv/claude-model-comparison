  "summary": "The agent successfully implemented a generator-based parameter binding system as requested, handling design decisions autonomously and recovering from multiple errors during implementation. The user's immediate follow-up to update examples suggests satisfaction with the core work, though minor scope refinement (generating values vs. registering generators) indicates slight initial misalignment that was corrected through iteration.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User pivoted to a follow-on task (updating the buyer example) rather than requesting fixes or clarifications, suggesting the core implementation met expectations. This is typical iteration within a cohesive feature set.",
