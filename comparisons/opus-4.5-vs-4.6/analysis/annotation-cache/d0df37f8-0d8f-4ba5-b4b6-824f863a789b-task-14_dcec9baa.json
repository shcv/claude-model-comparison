  "summary": "Agent successfully completed a parameter consolidation refactoring task by reading the codebase, identifying duplicate nono parameter patterns, and systematically editing code to use single shared parameters across actions. The work was focused and autonomous, with appropriate error recovery when encountering test failures. The empty follow-up message suggests user acceptance, though some ambiguity remains about whether all edge cases were fully addressed.",
