The next message suggests user is exploring alternative solutions, indicating the task completed as requested but may not have been the user's preferred long-term approach. Minor misalignment: agent could have proactively noted that source-level version downgrading might be a better alternative to binary patching.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User pivoted to a source-level solution, suggesting they want to avoid binary patching altogether by downgrading version requirements in source code instead. This indicates the binary patch may have worked but user prefers a cleaner upstream fix.",
