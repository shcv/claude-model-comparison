  "summary": "The agent performed thorough code investigation but misaligned with the user's implicit expectation of moving toward implementation. The user's follow-up proposing specific architectures indicates they were ready for design discussion or implementation planning, not additional reconnaissance. The multiple errors and lack of actionable recommendations left the user to drive the next direction themselves.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User shifted from asking for investigation to proposing specific architectural options for comparison, suggesting they're taking more directive control. They appear ready to move toward implementation decisions rather than continue exploration.",
