  "summary": "The agent attempted to fulfill a straightforward diagram request by spawning a subagent task but did not complete the work within this session. The user's immediate follow-up requesting an alternative format suggests the initial approach (Mermaid diagram) didn't meet expectations, indicating a misalignment between what the agent provided and what would have been most useful. No actual deliverable was produced for the user to evaluate.",
