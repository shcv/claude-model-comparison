However, execution fell short: an edit error was encountered and not fully recovered from, leaving the refactoring work incomplete. The user's empty follow-up message and session termination suggest either dissatisfaction with the error or a pause for reassessment before continuing.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The empty next message and session_end outcome suggest the user either paused to review the work, encountered the edit error and decided to handle it differently, or is evaluating the agent's investigation before providing further direction.",
