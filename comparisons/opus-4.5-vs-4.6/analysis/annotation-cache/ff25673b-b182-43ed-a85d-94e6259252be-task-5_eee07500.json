  "summary": "Agent successfully completed the requested work of fetching/organizing feedback and implementing prefix-based selection, but the user's immediate transition to new tasks without explicit approval suggests the first implementation may have been slightly incomplete or that refinement in the next phase will be needed. High autonomy and error recovery demonstrate competent execution, though the 10 edit errors and significant iteration indicate the work was more complex than initially apparent.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User launched directly into next feature requests (shake-to-report fix, screenshot capturing) without acknowledging prior work, indicating either seamless handoff or tacit approval. This suggests agent should have delivered sufficient completeness to enable next phase.",
