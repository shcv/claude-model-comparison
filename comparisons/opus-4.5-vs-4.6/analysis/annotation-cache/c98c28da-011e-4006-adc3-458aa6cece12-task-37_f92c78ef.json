  "summary": "The agent effectively implemented the requested GitHub automation features with clear, focused work and no errors. The subsequent user request for file renaming and backfill work indicates the initial implementation was largely correct but incomplete in addressing the full operational scope. This represents solid execution with minor misalignment on the complete end-to-end workflow the user envisioned.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User accepted the initial work and is now requesting a refinement (rename) plus additional operational work (backfilling tags on existing PRs). This suggests the implementation was functionally acceptable but needed adjustment, indicating iterative development rather than complete initial success.",
