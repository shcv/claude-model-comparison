  "user_sentiment": "Mixed - the user accepted the investigation work but immediately redirected focus, suggesting they wanted a more specific outcome or had clarified their thinking about schema validation priorities.",

  "summary": "The agent performed a thorough investigation of protocol implementation details using appropriate delegation, identifying structural divergences and providing detailed findings. While the work was well-executed and complete, the immediate pivot to schema validation suggests the user may have wanted more actionable recommendations or a different analytical focus. The work appears to have served as useful groundwork for the subsequent implementation task.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User pivoted to a new implementation task (schema validation in the bridge) with explicit design guidance, indicating the investigation was useful context-setting work but the real task was implementation-focused.",
