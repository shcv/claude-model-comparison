  "summary": "The agent successfully moved a vague architectural discussion into concrete planning by entering plan mode, reading relevant code, creating two detailed architectural proposals with tradeoffs, and obtaining user approval. The work was well-scoped and focused on the user's stated goal of \"implementing both for consideration and comparison.\" One minor alignment gap: the user mentioned the need for \"more planning\" on multiple options, but the agent delivered exactly two architectures rather than exploring a broader design space with multiple options per approach.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User will likely review the plan document and either request implementation of one architecture, request modifications to the plan, or provide additional guidance on architectural decisions.",
