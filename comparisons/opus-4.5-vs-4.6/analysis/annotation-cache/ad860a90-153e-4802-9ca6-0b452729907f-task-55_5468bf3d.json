However, the next user message reporting a socket timeout error suggests the original XOAUTH2 issue wasn't fully resolved, indicating partial success and need for continued iteration on the underlying authentication problem.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User reported a new error (socket/timeout) rather than confirming the fix worked. This suggests either the XOAUTH2 fix was unsuccessful or the user moved forward and encountered a secondary network-level issue. Further iteration expected.",
