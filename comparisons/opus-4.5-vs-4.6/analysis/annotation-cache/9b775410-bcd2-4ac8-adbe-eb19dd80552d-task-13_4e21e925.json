  "summary": "The agent successfully delegated worktree preparation to subagents as requested, demonstrating good use of parallel task execution. The follow-up message indicates external constraints have changed (fudge unavailable), not dissatisfaction with the completed work. Minor misalignment exists in that the agent prepared infrastructure for a testing approach that is no longer viable, though the worktrees themselves remain useful.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user is pivoting the testing strategy due to tool availability constraints. They're indicating that the project needs to adapt from testing with fudge to using opus for replication. This suggests the prior worktree preparation work is still valid, but the testing methodology needs adjustment.",
