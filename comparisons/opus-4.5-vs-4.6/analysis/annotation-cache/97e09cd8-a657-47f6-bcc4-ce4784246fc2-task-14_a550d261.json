  "summary": "The agent performed systematic research on compact mode and diff matching, but the follow-up question indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the user's intent. The user expected the matching algorithm to distinguish and elide rename noise from structural changes, but the agent's investigation apparently included rename changes in the output, suggesting it didn't fully grasp the filtering requirement. This represents a significant alignment gap requiring clarification and rework.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is asking a clarifying question about the agent's output, suggesting the investigation results didn't match their expected understanding of how the matching/filtering should work. This typically leads to the agent re-examining the findings or approach.",
