However, the user's follow-up 'ok, let's do 2' suggests they expected the agent to have already proposed numbered options, implying a communication gap\u2014the user may have understood they were selecting from a pre-discussed list rather than acknowledging a new conversation. The agent needed to confirm which specific option the user meant before implementing.",
