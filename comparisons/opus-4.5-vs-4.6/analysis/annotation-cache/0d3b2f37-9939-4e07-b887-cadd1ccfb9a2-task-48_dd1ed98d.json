  "user_sentiment": "neutral_to_positive - the user moved directly to a new request (webhook support planning) without expressing dissatisfaction, suggesting they either accepted the agent's analysis or were ready to move forward",
  "sentiment_confidence": "medium",
  "execution_quality": "The agent systematically read the relevant script, tested the current behavior with bash commands, understood the issue, and identified the solution, though the actual implementation wasn't completed in this interaction.",
  "work_category": "Debugging and problem-solving task where the agent investigated a demo script's server lifecycle behavior and proposed a fix to ensure cleanup when the script creates a server.",
  "scope_management": "focused - agent stayed narrowly on the specific issue of server cleanup without expanding into related concerns",
  "communication_quality": "adequate - agent explained its findings and recommendations but could have been more explicit about what remained to be done",
  "error_recovery": "recovered - agent encountered 4 errors during bash execution but worked through them to understand the script behavior",
  "iteration_required": "one_shot - the user didn't ask for revisions or clarifications before moving to the next task",

  "summary": "The agent successfully investigated the demo script's server lifecycle behavior and identified that cleanup was needed when the script creates its own server. While the analysis was thorough and the solution clear, the agent stopped short of implementing the actual fix. The user's immediate pivot to a new planning task suggests they were satisfied with the investigation enough to move forward, though implementation would have completed the original request more fully.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User pivoted to a new planning task rather than asking for implementation, indicating they may have accepted the findings and wanted to shift focus to a broader feature discussion",
  "autonomy_level": "high - the agent independently investigated, diagnosed the issue, and formulated recommendations without needing clarification",
