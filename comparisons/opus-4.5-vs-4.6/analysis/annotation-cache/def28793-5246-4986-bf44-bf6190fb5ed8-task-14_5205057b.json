  "summary": "The agent successfully created a curated set of genuinely challenging interview problems (median time ~90 minutes) by designing original algorithmic challenges spanning graph theory, dynamic programming, and system design. The work was autonomously executed with clean file organization and no errors. The empty follow-up message suggests user satisfaction, though minor misalignment exists around whether all problems truly fit the exact 90-minute constraint without clarification of difficulty calibration.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "Session ended without follow-up, suggesting the user accepted the work and moved on. No requests for revision or additional changes.",
