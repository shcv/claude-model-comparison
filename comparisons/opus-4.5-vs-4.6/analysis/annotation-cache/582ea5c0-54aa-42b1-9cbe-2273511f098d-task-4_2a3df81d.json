  "summary": "The agent initiated the standard git commit workflow in response to a simple request to commit changes, but the user interrupted the process before completion. While the agent's approach was methodologically sound (checking status, reviewing diffs), the task never reached the actual commit step. The interruption suggests potential misalignment with what the user intended or preferred in terms of commit process, leaving the core request unfulfilled.",
