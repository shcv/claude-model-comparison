The agent did not execute work but appears to have understood the user's request for code review quality standards with project-specific overrides. The user's follow-up refinement ('mostly generic, but project specific overrides') indicates partial alignment on the initial concept\u2014the agent likely described a generic approach that needed localization, and the user corrected course for the next iteration.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user is clarifying requirements before implementation. Expectation is that the agent will now implement code review standards with both generic defaults and project-specific customization support.",
