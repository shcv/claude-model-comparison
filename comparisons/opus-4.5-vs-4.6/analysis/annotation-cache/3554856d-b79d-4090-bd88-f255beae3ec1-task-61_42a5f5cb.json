User's follow-up request for installation, execution, and statistics collection indicates the conceptual analysis wasn't what was actually needed\u2014the user wanted empirical data. The low tool usage and lack of concrete progress suggests misalignment between the conversational response and the user's underlying need for hands-on measurement work.",
