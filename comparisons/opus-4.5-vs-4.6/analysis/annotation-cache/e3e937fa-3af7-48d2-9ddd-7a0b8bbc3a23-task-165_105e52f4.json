With zero tool calls and the user's follow-up question, it's clear the agent either misunderstood the request or provided insufficient clarification. Significant iteration would be needed to understand the user's actual intent.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user's next message indicates continued confusion or normal back-and-forth. Expected follow-up would be agent clarification question or discovery of what the user actually needs (a push-key utility, Guix configuration, keyboard shortcuts, or domain-specific scripting).",
