  "summary": "The agent did not engage with the user's initial troubleshooting request about DNS/routing configuration, making zero tool calls in 9 seconds. The user then reframed their request as looking up documentation for manual steps. The lack of any visible response or investigation created a complete misalignment with the user's actual need for help diagnosing or documenting a technical problem.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User escalated by offering an alternative (manual instructions) when the agent didn't respond to the initial troubleshooting request. Expected next step: agent provides documentation or walkthrough, or task is interrupted.",
