  "summary": "The agent successfully combined the start scripts as requested, but the implementation created new problems (UI glitching) rather than solving the core issue. The user's follow-up indicates they wanted a working unified startup, not just a merged script that introduced new bugs. The user is now proposing architectural changes (event-driven model) rather than accepting the delivered solution, suggesting misalignment between what was delivered and what was actually needed.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is pivoting from the immediate task to discuss root cause (auto-refresh cycle) and propose architectural solution (event-driven updates). This suggests the combined script works but has unintended side effects that need design-level thinking.",
