  "summary": "The agent performed a methodical code exploration to understand the pretty library's syntax highlighting implementation across platforms, using appropriate search and read tools to navigate the codebase. However, the investigation remained incomplete\u2014the agent didn't reach definitive conclusions about platform-specific differences or validate/test the user's hypothesis about line-ending-related color offset bugs. The user's follow-up message indicates they formulated their own theory based on partial findings, suggesting the agent's work provided useful context but fell short of fully answering the core question about cross-platform color code differences and the Windows Terminal color offset issue.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user continued the conversation with a technical hypothesis about the root cause (line ending expansion), indicating they expected the agent to either validate this hypothesis or help debug the specific color-offset behavior they observed. This suggests the initial investigation provided enough context for the user to formulate a testable theory.",
