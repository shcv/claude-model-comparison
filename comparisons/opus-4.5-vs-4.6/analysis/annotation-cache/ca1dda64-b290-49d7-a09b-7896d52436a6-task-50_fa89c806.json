However, multiple edit conflicts and the need to retry changes five times suggests implementation friction. The user's follow-up identifies a specific asymmetry in the output, indicating the debugging approach was partially effective but didn't fully resolve the underlying issue\u2014more investigation is needed rather than confirmation that setup was correct.",
