The user's follow-up message indicates the initial implementation approach was not what was needed, requiring restructuring around 'proxy' and 'executor' subdirectories with demos rather than the higher-level architectural documentation that was created.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User provided architectural clarification (rename to 'proxy' and 'executor', restructure as subdirectories, remove peach layer dependency, create demo directories with setup scripts) - suggests agent's initial approach needed redirection before proceeding further.",
