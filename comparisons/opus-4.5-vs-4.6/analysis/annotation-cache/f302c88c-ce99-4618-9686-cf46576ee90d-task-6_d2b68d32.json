  "summary": "The agent successfully executed a previously-discussed implementation task involving file modifications and bash commands, completing it efficiently with minimal errors. The user's immediate pivot to a new feature request suggests acceptance of the work, though the terse initial instruction ('yeah do that') left some ambiguity about full intent. The work appears focused and well-executed, ready to support the next iteration.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User immediately pivots to a new feature request (launching cool-retro-term from claude-coder), indicating the prior task was acceptable and they're building on that momentum. This suggests iterative feature development rather than debugging or fixes.",
