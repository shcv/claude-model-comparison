However, the user's rapid pivot to 'skip embeddings' and ask about API key placement suggests either the pricing research wasn't what they ultimately needed or they decided to move forward despite incomplete information. The agent stayed on task but may have missed some underlying requirement or context about the actual problem they were solving.",
