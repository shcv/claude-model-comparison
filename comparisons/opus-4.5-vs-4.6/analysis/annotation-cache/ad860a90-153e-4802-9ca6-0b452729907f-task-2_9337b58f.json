  "summary": "The agent provided solid advisory on credential caching strategies with appropriate security warnings, but the conversation remains in the exploratory phase rather than execution. The user's follow-up reveals they're weighing practical concerns about security and timeout adequacy, and expect deeper engagement with these specific constraints rather than just general guidance.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user is evaluating feasibility and security implications. They likely expect the agent to address their specific concerns about environment variable security and timeout duration in the next exchange, or to help them implement the chosen approach.",
