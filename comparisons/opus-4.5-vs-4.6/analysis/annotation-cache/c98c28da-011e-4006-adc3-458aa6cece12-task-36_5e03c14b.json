The follow-up message reveals the user intended label-related work plus two CI/CD automation features, indicating a significant gap between what was requested and what was delivered. The agent needs to clarify the scope and begin implementing the outstanding features.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User shifted from completing the prior task to introducing two new, more complex requirements: (1) CI/CD push-to-dev check with tag validation, and (2) automatic component tag assignment based on code changes using a component.yaml mapping. This suggests the user is building momentum on the project.",
