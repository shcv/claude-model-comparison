  "summary": "Agent successfully implemented shake detection and gesture triggering for the submission UI with multiple code iterations and debugging cycles. However, the incomplete verification combined with immediate task context switch suggests potential misalignment between the agent's implementation approach and user expectations, or that the user felt the first task was sufficiently started. The work was technically competent but may not have fully satisfied the stated goal of avoiding settings page disruption to screenshots.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User immediately pivoted to a new, unrelated task (server setup on skyhook) without confirming the gesture feature worked or providing feedback, suggesting either satisfaction or deprioritization of the original request.",
