  "summary": "Agent successfully implemented the requested provider abstraction architecture with proper abstraction layers, configuration management, and task-based routing logic. The implementation was methodical and completed as specified, though the subsequent request for a 'simple demo' suggests the user may want to validate or extend the work with concrete examples rather than accept it as fully done.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User moved to requesting a new, simpler concrete task (whisper STT demo) rather than iterating on the architecture work, suggesting they either accepted the implementation as sufficient or want to validate it with a practical example before further refinement.",
