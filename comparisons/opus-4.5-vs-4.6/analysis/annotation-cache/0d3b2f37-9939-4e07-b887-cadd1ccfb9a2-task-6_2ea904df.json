The user accepted this foundation and moved directly to requesting implementation of a general-purpose mapping layer. The agent stayed focused on the initial inquiry but did not anticipate or suggest the design approach that the user ultimately requested, resulting in minor misalignment on scope expectations.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is pivoting from exploration to design: asking the agent to create a general-purpose mapping layer that uses JSON schemas directly to minimize custom UCP-specific code. This is a specification/design task that should follow the exploratory analysis.",
