The user's next message adds a second major requirement (task categorization) that wasn't addressed, indicating the agent misread the initial incomplete request and proceeded without waiting for full clarification, resulting in partial alignment with actual intent.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user continued the sentence from the initial message and added a new requirement, indicating the first message was incomplete. The agent would be expected to incorporate both concerns: improving scoring metrics/motivations and adding task categorization.",
