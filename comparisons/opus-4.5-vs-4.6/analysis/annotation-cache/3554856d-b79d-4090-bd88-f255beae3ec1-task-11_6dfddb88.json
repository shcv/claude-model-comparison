  "summary": "Agent was executing a multi-agent coordination task to review keynet project specifications, using SendMessage and TaskList tools to route work between validator agents. The task was interrupted mid-handoff when validator-2 began submitting validation results, creating a continuation pattern rather than a discrete completion. While the agent stayed focused on specification review coordination, the truncated state and incomplete next message make full assessment of intent-alignment difficult.",
