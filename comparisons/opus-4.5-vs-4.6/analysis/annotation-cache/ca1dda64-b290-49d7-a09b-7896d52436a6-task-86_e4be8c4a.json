The user's acceptance of the 'good enough' state and immediate pivot to investigating microphone hardware suggests the ONNX issue was a blocker to the real problem they wanted to solve. The work was methodical but ultimately incomplete, though the user pragmatically moved forward with their investigation rather than requesting further fixes on this specific issue.",
