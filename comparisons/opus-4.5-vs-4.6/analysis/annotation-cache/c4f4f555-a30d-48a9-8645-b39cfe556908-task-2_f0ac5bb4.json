  "summary": "The agent attempted to implement a complex shell launcher feature with conditional CRT auto-launch, making progress through multiple edits but encountering repeated errors that required recovery. The incomplete implementation and the user's immediate request to 'run a random script' suggests misalignment: the user may have wanted a working, testable solution rather than mid-implementation status, or the plan was not fully actionable as provided.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user shifted from implementation review to requesting test execution, indicating they either wanted to see results quickly or were ready to test the changes made. This could signal satisfaction with progress or desire to move forward.",
