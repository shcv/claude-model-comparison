  "summary": "Agent performed standard troubleshooting steps (read, write, bash execution) in response to a cryptic initial request, then the user clarified the actual context was network infrastructure setup rather than code debugging. The initial work appears misaligned with the user's actual intent (network verification), though error recovery was handled. The low alignment score reflects the gap between what was done and what the user actually needed\u2014verification of external IP visibility after network device connection.",
