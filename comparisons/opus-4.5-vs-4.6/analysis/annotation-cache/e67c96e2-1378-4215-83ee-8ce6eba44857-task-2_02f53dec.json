  "summary": "The agent took a research-first approach by examining git branches and naming patterns via bash commands, but stopped short of performing the requested renaming work. With no files edited and the session ending after exploration only, the task appears interrupted before completion. The vague initial request ('give them more readable names, like the feature branches') required interpretation, but the agent's exploration phase didn't lead to clarifying questions or actual implementation.",
