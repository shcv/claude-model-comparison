  "summary": "The agent made meaningful progress on chart redesign requests but only partially addressed the user's stated preferences. The user's next message ('it's getting closer') combined with specific new requirements indicates the work moved in the right direction but missed critical details\u2014particularly around data refresh and result positioning. Multiple edit errors and the need for additional iterations suggest the agent struggled with the complexity of the visualization changes requested.",
