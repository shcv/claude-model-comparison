However, it appears to have only partially addressed the user's follow-up question about event loop management, suggesting the initial exploration may not have been thorough enough.",

  "summary": "The agent performed a straightforward code exploration to answer the initial question about sync/async methods, but the user's immediate follow-up reveals the investigation didn't fully address their core architectural concerns about event loop management and concurrent adapter usage. The agent needs to examine how the adapter manages event loops and whether it can integrate with external loop management, which represents a deeper architectural question than what was initially explored.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is asking a more specific architectural question about event loop isolation and the ability to run multiple adapter instances concurrently. This indicates they want to understand constraints and possibilities for their use case.",
