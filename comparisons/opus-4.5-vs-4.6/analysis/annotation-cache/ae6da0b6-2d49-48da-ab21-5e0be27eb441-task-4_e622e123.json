  "summary": "The agent investigated a broken parallel execution issue, made multiple attempts to fix it through task management and code corrections, but didn't fully align with the user's actual requirement around model naming conventions. The user's follow-up suggests the core issue remains - the agent should have used canonical API model names (opus-4-6, opus-4-5) rather than internal naming, indicating a gap between what was attempted and what was actually needed.",
