  "summary": "The agent systematically implemented a multi-file refactoring plan to unify normalized diffing in astdiff, making 24 edits across multiple files while iteratively addressing errors and debugging issues. Work was interrupted by context limits before completion verification, though the agent's focused approach and error recovery suggest reasonable progress toward the stated goals. The high number of edit errors suggests the refactoring involved complex interdependencies, but the agent successfully navigated them to move forward.",
