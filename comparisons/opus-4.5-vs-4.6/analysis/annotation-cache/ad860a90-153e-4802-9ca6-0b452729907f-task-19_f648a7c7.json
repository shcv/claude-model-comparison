However, the user's message is incomplete and contains a partial request that cuts off mid-sentence, preventing full understanding of the desired solution. The user appears dissatisfied with the prior approach and is proposing a multi-part alternative (archive read mail only, update server state, handle multiple sources), but clarity is needed before implementation can proceed.",
