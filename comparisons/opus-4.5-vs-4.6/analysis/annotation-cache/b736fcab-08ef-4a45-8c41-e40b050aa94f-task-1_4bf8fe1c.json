However, it did not respond to the follow-up request for impact analysis on agent usage of broadcast features, which appears to have been the actual decision point for the refactoring. The partial completion and lack of proactive impact assessment suggest the agent missed the substantive intent behind the second message\u2014the user wanted confirmation that broadcast removal was safe before committing to code changes.",
