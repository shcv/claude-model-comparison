  "summary": "Agent performed focused technical research on SDK patterns through code examination, but the shift from the first question (skill passing to Task) to a second unrelated question (automatic agent generation) suggests the first answer may not have fully addressed user's underlying intent. The user is exploring SDK capabilities systematically rather than solving a concrete problem, which requires responsive iteration to understand what they're ultimately trying to accomplish.",
