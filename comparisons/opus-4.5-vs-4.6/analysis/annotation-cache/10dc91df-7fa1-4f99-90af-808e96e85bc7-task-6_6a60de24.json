However, the work stalled on resolving the summarize function\u2014the agent didn't confirm whether the SDK is installed or verify the actual import error\u2014leaving the user with a clarifying question about SDK naming rather than a working solution. The focused investigation approach was appropriate, but execution fell short of completing either fix.",
