  "summary": "The agent ran a version release analysis script that produced a 'resource not accessible' GraphQL error, indicating an authentication or permission issue with the GitHub integration. The user's follow-up message was cut off before they could fully describe the problem, leaving unclear whether the agent had properly diagnosed or should have preemptively addressed the permission constraints. This represents a misalignment between the user's intent (fixing or understanding the release failure) and the agent's execution (running the script without context about access restrictions).",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User attempted to report an error they encountered ('resource not accessi[ble]') and was providing context for the agent to debug. Expected next step would be error resolution or explanation of the GraphQL permission issue.",
