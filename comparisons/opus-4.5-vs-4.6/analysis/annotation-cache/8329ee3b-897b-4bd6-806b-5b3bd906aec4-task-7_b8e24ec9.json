  "user_sentiment": "Somewhat confused or seeking clarification. The 'hmm' opening followed by a series of specific technical questions (firmware version, upgrade/downgrade process, reset timing) suggests the user either didn't find the answer they needed in the previous response or wants more specific guidance.",

  "summary": "The agent performed research-focused web searches and fetches to help the user understand a process they wanted to follow manually. However, the approach of returning raw search results without synthesis or clear guidance left the user needing follow-up clarification on specific technical details about firmware versioning and SSH troubleshooting. The partial alignment and follow-up questions indicate the initial response didn't fully address the user's actual needs.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is asking follow-up questions that drill deeper into the technical details of firmware management and SSH access. This indicates they likely didn't get complete answers from the prior research and are now asking for more targeted help with specific sub-problems.",
