The user completed the interview prep work independently in ~45 minutes and is now seeking design advice and the agent's thoughts on extensibility patterns. The zero tool calls and instant 11-second completion indicate the agent appropriately recognized this as a discussion prompt rather than a request for code work, but the partial alignment score reflects uncertainty about whether the agent's response properly addressed the user's implicit request for design guidance.",
