  "summary": "Agent successfully created a second version of a purchase example using the enablement pattern. The work involved systematic exploration of existing code, pattern understanding, implementation, and debugging across 40 tool calls. While execution was solid and errors were recovered from, the user's immediate commit request without praise or review comments suggests the work met requirements but may not have exceeded expectations. Alignment was strong with the core task.",
