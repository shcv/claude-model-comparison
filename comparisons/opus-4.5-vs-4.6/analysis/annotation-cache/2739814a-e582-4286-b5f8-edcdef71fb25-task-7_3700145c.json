However, the user's immediate pivot to reconsidering application architecture suggests either unclear initial requirements or that the deployment work surfaced questions about the system design itself, indicating partial alignment with the user's broader intent.",

This indicates the prior work may have prompted reconsideration of the overall system design rather than acceptance of the deployment approach.",
