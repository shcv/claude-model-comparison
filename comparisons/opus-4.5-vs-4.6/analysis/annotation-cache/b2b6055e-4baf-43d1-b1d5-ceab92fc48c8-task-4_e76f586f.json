  "summary": "Agent systematically approached the multi-instance split picker implementation by entering plan mode, exploring the codebase via a subagent, and writing code. The process was methodical and well-organized, but without user feedback on the next message, it's unclear if the implementation actually addresses what the user needed or if further iteration is required. The one-shot approach suggests the agent believed it completed the task fully, though typical feature work might need testing or refinement.",
