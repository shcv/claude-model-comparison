  "summary": "The agent mishandled a context-recovery scenario by attempting to spawn a Task subagent when faced with an incomplete task summary. The session data was truncated mid-analysis, and rather than asking clarifying questions or acknowledging the incomplete input, the agent proceeded with an ill-defined tool call that predictably failed. Recovery requires the agent to recognize incomplete input and explicitly request completion of the analysis context.",
