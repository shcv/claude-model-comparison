  "summary": "The agent performed a straightforward web search task with good execution, but the partial task completion and user's pivot toward practical observations (device state change, telnet note) suggests the search results may not have fully satisfied the underlying intent. The user appears to be engaged in active troubleshooting rather than purely informational research, indicating misalignment between the research focus and the practical problem-solving context.",
