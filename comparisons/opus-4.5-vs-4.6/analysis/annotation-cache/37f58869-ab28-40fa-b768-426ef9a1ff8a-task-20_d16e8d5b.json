However, the implementation inadvertently broke unrelated chart functionality, suggesting the changes either had broader side effects or weren't properly tested before deployment. This represents a critical misalignment because while the skeleton loading feature may have been implemented correctly, the net result was a broken application rather than an improved user experience.",
