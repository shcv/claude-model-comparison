  "summary": "The agent successfully executed a multi-step data analysis task, creating shell scripts to parse Claude Code session logs, identify recent model usage, and calculate token throughput rates. The work was technically sound with good error recovery, though the empty follow-up message leaves uncertainty about whether the specific analytical results met the user's expectations for token rate estimates.",
