However, the session terminated without producing the requested changelog output, with 7 errors encountered during execution and no deliverable generated, indicating misalignment between the exploratory work performed and the user's actual need for a formatted changelog document.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "Silent session termination suggests either: (1) user found the partial results insufficient and abandoned the task, (2) user was waiting for a changelog output that never materialized, or (3) user encountered the 7 errors and decided to stop",
