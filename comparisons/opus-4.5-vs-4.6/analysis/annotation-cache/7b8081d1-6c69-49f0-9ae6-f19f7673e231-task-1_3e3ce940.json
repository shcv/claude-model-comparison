  "summary": "Agent successfully completed the requested task of creating testing utilities for multiple pricing APIs by researching available endpoints, documenting data models, and building functional Python tools for search and API interaction. The work was well-scoped and appropriately exploratory given the research-heavy nature of the request. The lack of follow-up feedback suggests either satisfaction with the deliverables or the user evaluating the work offline.",
