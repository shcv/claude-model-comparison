  "summary": "The agent correctly interpreted the user's request to check existing Guix configuration for idle timeout settings and systematically located the relevant configuration file and values. The user's follow-up question about disabling idle resets suggests they understood the findings and are now exploring configuration implications, indicating the initial task met their needs.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User asked a clarifying question about the behavior when idle time resets are disabled, indicating they want to understand the interaction between two security features (idle timeout and pin caching). This suggests the user is evaluating configuration options.",
