The user's question about 'the above sketch' cannot be answered without understanding what code or context they're referencing. The agent needs to either locate the missing context or request the user clarify what they want explained.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user is asking for an explanation of a code sketch (likely a function called get_enabled), which implies either: (1) they expected the agent to have produced or shown this code in the interrupted request, or (2) they are referencing an external/local context. The agent should ask for clarification or request the code to be provided.",
