  "summary": "The agent began a reasonable investigation approach with subagent delegation and async refactoring, but the task was interrupted before completion. The user's follow-up shows a different error (PortAudio sample rate issue) rather than confirmation of the hanging being fixed, suggesting the agent may have misdiagnosed the root cause or the work wasn't comprehensive enough to address the Emacs synchronization blocking issue.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User switched from requesting investigation work to showing a concrete PortAudio sample rate error. This suggests they may have tested the code before the agent completed the async refactoring work, or the async changes weren't the root cause of the hanging.",
