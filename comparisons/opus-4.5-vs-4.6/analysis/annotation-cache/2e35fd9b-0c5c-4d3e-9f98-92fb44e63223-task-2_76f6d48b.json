  "user_sentiment": "Neutral to uncertain - the empty next_user_message after session termination is ambiguous; could indicate satisfaction with planning phase, or incomplete work requiring continuation.",
  "sentiment_confidence": "low",
  "execution_quality": "The agent demonstrated thorough analysis by exploring the codebase extensively, identifying key files and patterns, and presenting a structured plan with clear phases. However, actual implementation was minimal with only 2 edit events and 8 errors encountered, suggesting execution challenges.",

The agent entered plan mode, researched the codebase structure, designed an implementation approach for multiple test harnesses and conformance fixtures, and obtained user approval.",

  "summary": "The agent appropriately used plan mode to analyze a multi-part test infrastructure task, conducted extensive codebase research, and proposed a structured implementation approach. However, the plan was approved but execution remained incomplete with limited edits and multiple errors encountered, leaving the core implementation work unfinished.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "Expected either user feedback on the plan, continued execution of the planned work in a follow-up session, or clarification on how to proceed with implementation.",
