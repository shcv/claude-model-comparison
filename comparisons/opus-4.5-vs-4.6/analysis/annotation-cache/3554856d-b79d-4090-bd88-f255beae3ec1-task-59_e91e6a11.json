  "summary": "The agent provided a conceptual explanation of cjdns label splicing and port allocation math without tool use. The user's follow-up question suggests the explanation was partially understood but lacked mathematical rigor or clarity on the exact bit-to-port mapping, indicating minor alignment gap rather than complete understanding.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is asking for mathematical clarification about implications of the previous explanation, indicating they're thinking through the concept rather than rejecting it.",
