  "summary": "This task records an interrupted interaction where the user's initial request was not captured, resulting in zero work performed before the session paused. The subsequent 'continue' message indicates the user wants to resume, but without the original request context, the agent cannot assess alignment with user intent. Significant clarification will be needed to establish what the user actually wants to accomplish.",
