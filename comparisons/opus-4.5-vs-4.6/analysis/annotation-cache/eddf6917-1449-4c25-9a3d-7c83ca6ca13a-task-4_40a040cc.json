  "user_sentiment": "Mildly curious or seeking clarification. The user's direct question about battery health after discussing battery life improvements suggests they want concrete data rather than just configuration changes.",

However, the follow-up question about battery health suggests the user may not have received the specific information they were seeking.",

  "summary": "The agent attempted a comprehensive power management optimization by exploring configurations and making edits, demonstrating good technical independence. However, the user's follow-up question about battery health indicates a gap in understanding what information they actually needed\u2014concrete battery diagnostics rather than configuration adjustments. The work was methodical but may not have directly addressed the user's core concern about achieving advertised 10-hour battery life.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user is asking for specific diagnostic information (battery health metrics), likely expecting the agent to query system diagnostics like `acpi -i` or check battery capacity files. This is a continuation of the same investigation, not a new task.",
