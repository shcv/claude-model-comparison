The agent did not produce code or artifacts; instead, the user was exploring tradeoffs (agent-side vs store-layer batching) and making rapid refinements (sync/async executors, blocking behavior, server-side filtering). The next message shows the user pivoting the design again, suggesting this was exploratory iteration rather than a settled request.",
