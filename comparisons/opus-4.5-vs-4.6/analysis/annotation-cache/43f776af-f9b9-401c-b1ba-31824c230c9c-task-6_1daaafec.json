  "summary": "The agent successfully investigated the user's questions about audio device configuration and threshold sensitivity, making informed adjustments to the codebase. The user's immediate follow-up with new feature requests indicates satisfaction with the prior work. Minor alignment gap exists as the agent may not have fully addressed all aspects of how the settings affect alternate devices, but this didn't prevent task progress.",
