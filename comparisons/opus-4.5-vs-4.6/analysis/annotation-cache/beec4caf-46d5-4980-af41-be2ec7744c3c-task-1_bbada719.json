  "summary": "The agent took a measured approach by asking clarifying questions rather than proposing solutions immediately, which is generally sound for underspecified problems. However, the user's follow-up reveals the agent's questions didn't uncover all dimensions of the desired verification workflow (quantitative correctness alone is insufficient; qualitative code quality matters too). The agent will need multiple iterations to fully capture requirements before transitioning to design and implementation phases.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is actively refining the scope by introducing qualitative code review criteria (sensible implementation, no duplication, efficient methods). This suggests the agent's initial questions didn't fully capture the multidimensional nature of code verification.",
