While no direct work was captured in the task metrics (0 tool calls, 0 files touched), the user received partial insights data about project areas and appeared satisfied with the outcome. The slight misalignment (score 4 vs 5) reflects the incomplete data shown in the next_user_message rather than agent execution quality.",
