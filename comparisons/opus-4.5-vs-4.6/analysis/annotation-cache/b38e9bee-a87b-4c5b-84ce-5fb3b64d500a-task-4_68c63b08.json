{
  "user_sentiment": "neutral to positive - empty next message with session_end suggests user was satisfied with the planning phase or the session naturally concluded, but no explicit confirmation of the direction",
  "sentiment_confidence": "medium",
  "execution_quality": "Agent systematically explored the codebase, entered plan mode appropriately, asked clarifying questions about scope and constraints, and coordinated with specialized agents for analysis. However, the session ended before concrete implementation was delivered, leaving the work incomplete.",
  "work_category": "Architectural planning and codebase analysis for refactoring HTTP proxy code to use OpenAPI specs and improve type safety. Agent explored the existing codebase, consulted with user on approach, and began planning implementation.",
  "scope_management": "appropriate - agent stayed focused on understanding the existing architecture before proposing changes, avoided jumping to implementation without proper analysis",
  "communication_quality": "clear - agent explained its exploration process and asked targeted questions to clarify scope and constraints",
  "error_recovery": "recovered - agent encountered 14 errors during exploration (likely permission/access issues) but continued systematically exploring available code paths",
  "iteration_required": "minor - one clarification question about scope, otherwise straightforward planning process",
  "task_completion": "partial - agent successfully completed planning and analysis phases, but did not deliver the simplified refactored code or implementation helpers/middleware that was the ultimate goal",
  "alignment_score": 3,
  "summary": "Agent successfully initiated a complex refactoring task by entering plan mode, analyzing the existing codebase structure, and gathering requirements through user questions. The planning phase was executed well with good architectural thinking, but the session ended before delivering the actual implementation of simplified proxy code and OpenAPI-based type helpers, leaving the primary deliverable incomplete despite good foundational work.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User would likely continue in a new session with implementation work based on the plan, or provide feedback on the proposed approach if the plan was already communicated",
  "autonomy_level": "high - agent independently explored codebase, made architectural decisions about planning approach, and escalated appropriately to specialized agents",
