The user's guidance on project prioritization indicates they were providing necessary context for the next phase, but the interaction was cut short, leaving the actual file edits incomplete.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User provided mid-task direction on how to prioritize projects (downplay codel and velcro, emphasize Claude Investigations with astdiff). This suggests the agent was expected to continue with file edits based on this feedback, but the message was cut off mid-sentence.",
