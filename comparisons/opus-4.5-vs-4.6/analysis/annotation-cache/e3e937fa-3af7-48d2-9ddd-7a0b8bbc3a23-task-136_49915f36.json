The brief follow-up with additional context and clarifying questions about boot-blocking behavior suggests the initial response didn't sufficiently answer whether Wireguard was set up or why it might not be. The user's pivot to requesting a specific key search indicates a need for more targeted assistance.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User pivots to a more specific request (search for Wireguard keys) with additional context about potential boot-blocking issues. This indicates the initial query response wasn't conclusive and the user is now providing more details to guide the search.",
