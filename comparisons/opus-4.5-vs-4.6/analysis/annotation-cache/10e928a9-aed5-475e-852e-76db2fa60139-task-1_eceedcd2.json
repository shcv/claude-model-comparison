The absence of a changelog output in the visible work summary combined with session termination without user feedback indicates the task may have been interrupted or the final deliverable was not successfully generated or communicated.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "Session ended without user response; typical for simple analysis tasks where the output either met expectations or the user moved on without further interaction. No indication of iteration needed.",
