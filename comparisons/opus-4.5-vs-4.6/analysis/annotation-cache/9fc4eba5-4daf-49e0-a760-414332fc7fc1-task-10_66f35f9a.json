  "summary": "The agent failed to engage with the task substantively, making zero tool calls despite being asked to analyze code relationships and identify handling of a requirement. The user had to explicitly direct the agent to fix specific functions and remove redundant code, indicating complete misalignment with the actual work needed and poor task execution.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User escalated from a clarifying question to explicit directive work, suggesting the agent's initial response was inadequate. The user then specified exactly what needed to be fixed, indicating they had to guide the agent rather than have it identify the issues proactively.",
