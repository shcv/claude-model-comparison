  "summary": "Agent began investigating a Claude Code freeze issue with bash commands but misdiagnosed the likely cause as a keepalive timeout. User's follow-up message indicated this theory was incorrect, suggesting the agent should have better understood the timing constraints or explored alternative failure modes from the start. The task requires continued iteration with a different investigative approach.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User challenged the keepalive hypothesis, suggesting the investigation should focus on different root causes. Likely expects continued debugging with revised theory.",
