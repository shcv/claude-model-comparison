  "summary": "The agent independently implemented the requested Go hook binary with socket connectivity, following the provided plan and handling most of the technical requirements. However, the high error count (95) and session termination without explicit completion confirmation suggests the implementation may have had unresolved issues or the binary wasn't fully validated before the session ended. The core work was on-track and aligned with the request, but execution confidence is reduced by the troubleshooting struggles.",
