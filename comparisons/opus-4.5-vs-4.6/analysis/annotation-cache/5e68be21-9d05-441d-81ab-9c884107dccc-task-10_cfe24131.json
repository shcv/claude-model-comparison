  "summary": "The agent successfully modified the agent communication system to add orchestrator hierarchy, but implemented message-reply patterns that the user immediately recognized as problematic. The user's follow-up suggests a deeper architectural shift is needed (promise-based invocation instead of async messaging), indicating the initial implementation missed the core intent. This requires significant iteration to reach the desired design.",
