The user's next message shows they wanted deeper analysis of why the diff tool failed, including examination of the current astdiff implementation and whether missed changes were in top-level variables vs. function internals. The work was appropriately scoped and executed with good autonomy, but didn't complete the full investigative arc the user envisioned.",
