  "summary": "The agent successfully created failure-case tests following the specified purchase example pattern, handling most of the work autonomously with minimal user guidance. While the agent encountered 17 errors during execution and required some iteration with edits and corrections, it ultimately delivered working test cases that the user was ready to commit. The straightforward follow-up request to commit suggests the user was satisfied with the implementation, though the lack of explicit approval leaves slight uncertainty about complete alignment with expectations.",
