The agent delivered on the immediate task but the user is now steering toward a more sophisticated approach, showing partial alignment with their underlying intent to build smarter feature validation.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user is proposing a feature enhancement: incorporate tip-checking logic to guide feature validation. This signals they want the agent to expand the current work with this new validation approach, representing a natural iteration rather than dissatisfaction.",
