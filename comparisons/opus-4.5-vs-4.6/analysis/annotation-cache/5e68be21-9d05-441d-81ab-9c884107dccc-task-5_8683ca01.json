  "user_sentiment": "Mixed satisfaction with frustration. User confirms the immediate issue is resolved ('ok; it's working') but expresses dissatisfaction with UX feedback mechanisms and potential architectural issues (missing narrator messages to agents).",

However, the investigation stopped once the user reported the issue was resolved, without deeper analysis of the underlying cause or confirmation of what actually fixed it.",

  "summary": "The agent successfully resolved the immediate configuration discovery issue through systematic debugging, achieving the user's stated goal. However, the resolution appears circumstantial rather than thoroughly understood, and the user's follow-up reveals underlying UX and architectural concerns that weren't addressed, indicating only partial alignment with the user's broader needs.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is pivoting from the resolved config issue to surface two new concerns: (1) lack of thinking/processing indicators in the UI, and (2) potential missing inter-agent communication from the narrator. These represent UX and architectural issues rather than continuation of the original debugging task.",
