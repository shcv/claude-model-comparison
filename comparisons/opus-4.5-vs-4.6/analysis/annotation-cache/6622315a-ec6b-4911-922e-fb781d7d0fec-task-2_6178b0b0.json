The user's follow-up question suggests the prior work was off-target, indicating poor initial clarification and a need to pivot toward validating an existing emacs-pinentry setup rather than reconfiguring the system.",

Likely expects the agent to pivot to validating the existing setup rather than reconfiguring.",
