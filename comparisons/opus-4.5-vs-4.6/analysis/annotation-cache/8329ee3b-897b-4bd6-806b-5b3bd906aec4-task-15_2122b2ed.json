The user's follow-up question about gateway updates suggests the agent either didn't research the WAN solution adequately or didn't address key feasibility concerns before attempting implementation. Significant misalignment between what the user needed (informed analysis of the approach) and what was delivered (failed execution attempts).",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is asking the agent to research a specific topic (WAN approach) and raising a valid concern about gateway updates, indicating they want deeper analysis of feasibility rather than proceeding with initial approach.",
