The two errors encountered suggest the agent struggled with something in the investigation. The user seems to be proposing a different solution path (internal refactoring) rather than confirming the original comparison was complete or helpful.",

This is a continuation of discussion rather than reaction to agent work, suggesting the conversation was interrupted or the agent's previous work didn't fully resolve the comparison question.",
