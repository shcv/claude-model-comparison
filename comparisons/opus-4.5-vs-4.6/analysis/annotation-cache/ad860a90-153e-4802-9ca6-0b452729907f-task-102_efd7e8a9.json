While one email account succeeded, the agent's approach didn't address the pinentry synchronization problem that recurred with subsequent authentication attempts. The user had to continue debugging independently and identified the actual issue (async pinentry triggering), suggesting the agent's solution was a workaround rather than a fix.",
