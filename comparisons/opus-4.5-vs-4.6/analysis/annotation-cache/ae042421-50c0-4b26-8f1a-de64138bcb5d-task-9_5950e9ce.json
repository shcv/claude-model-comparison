  "summary": "The agent worked independently on issue #47 with reasonable technical execution, exploring gesture handling and UI interactions through multiple iterations. However, the initial approach (long-press everywhere) missed the mark on UX design and conflicted with other features, requiring the user to provide corrective guidance. The follow-up feedback suggests the agent would have benefited from better initial UX thinking or clarification on interaction patterns before implementation.",
