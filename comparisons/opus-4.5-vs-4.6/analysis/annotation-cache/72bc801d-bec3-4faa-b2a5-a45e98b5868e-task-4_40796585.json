  "summary": "The agent successfully completed the requested planning task by exploring the codebase structure, understanding the current demo implementation, and producing a well-organized refactoring plan. The work was methodical and appropriately scoped, though the slight alignment gap (4 vs 5) stems from the user's empty follow-up message making it unclear if the plan fully matched their expectations or if they wanted more specific technical guidance during planning.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User likely reviewed the written plan offline and will either implement it themselves or provide feedback in a future session. The empty message suggests no immediate issues or requests for revision.",
