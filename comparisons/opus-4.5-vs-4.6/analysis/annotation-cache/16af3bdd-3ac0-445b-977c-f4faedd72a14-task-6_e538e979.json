  "user_sentiment": "neutral to slightly impatient - the user's follow-up message suggests they expected action on the initial query and are now providing more explicit direction",

  "summary": "The agent failed to respond to a straightforward status check request and provided no output or tool usage. The user's follow-up message indicates dissatisfaction, pivoting to a more directive second request combining status, cleanup, and commit operations. This represents a significant misalignment where a simple git status query should have been executed immediately.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user escalated to a more specific task (cleanup and commit), indicating the initial query was not answered satisfactorily. This suggests the agent either failed to respond or misunderstood the initial request.",
