The user's follow-up 'actually' indicates the agent likely misidentified which system was failing (assumed the primary target rather than skyhook), suggesting the investigation wasn't thorough enough to pinpoint the real problem before the user had to correct course.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User's 'actually' correction suggests the agent may have misdiagnosed the problem. This triggers re-investigation of a different system (skyhook) and questions whether earlier steps were missed, indicating the user is uncertain if the problem was properly located.",
