  "summary": "The agent methodically approached the cascading interrupts stress test experiment by entering plan mode, researching the codebase structure, consulting the user on design decisions, and beginning to set up the experiment framework. While the foundational work was sound and well-planned, the actual implementation of the test itself appears incomplete as the session ended after initial setup phases. The agent stayed focused on the requested experiment and demonstrated good judgment in seeking user guidance on key architectural choices.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "Session ended without user follow-up, suggesting either the user was satisfied with the planning/setup phase or chose to continue work asynchronously outside this conversation.",
