The user's follow-up with concrete browser errors suggests the initial investigation missed critical setup or configuration problems, requiring substantial further iteration to resolve the actual problem.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User provided concrete error output (NS_ERROR_CORRUPTED_CONTENT, failed module load) indicating they took further action. This suggests the investigation wasn't sufficient to resolve their initial question, and they attempted to access the page anyway, leading to new technical errors.",
