  "summary": "Agent successfully restructured the agent panel UI layout, reorganized form display logic, and addressed the immediate concerns about enactment selection and history visibility. However, the follow-up message introducing a completely different layout concept (sidebar-based protocol system) suggests the original implementation wasn't fully aligned with the user's intended architecture, indicating the agent built a reasonable interpretation but missed some key design intent.",
