The wrapper works manually but still fails when mcron executes it, indicating the real issue (likely missing PATH or environment variables in the mcron execution context) wasn't actually resolved. User's follow-up suggests they need different troubleshooting approaches, not just a wrapper.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is reporting that despite the wrapper working manually, it still didn't execute properly in the mcron job after reconfiguring. This suggests either: (1) the wrapper wasn't actually invoked by mcron, (2) there's an environment/permissions issue specific to mcron context, or (3) the reconfiguration didn't take effect properly. User appears to be looking for further troubleshooting.",
