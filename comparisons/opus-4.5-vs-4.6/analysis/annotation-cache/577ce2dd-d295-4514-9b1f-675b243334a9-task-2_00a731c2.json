  "summary": "Agent successfully completed a complex multi-phase implementation task involving architecture planning, file setup, and task coordination for an interruptions system. While the initial 'continue' was ambiguous, the agent appropriately engaged planning mode and structured work methodically. The 15 edit errors encountered during execution were recovered from without blocking progress, though this suggests some friction in the implementation phase. User's follow-up indicates approval of the work and readiness to proceed to testing.",
