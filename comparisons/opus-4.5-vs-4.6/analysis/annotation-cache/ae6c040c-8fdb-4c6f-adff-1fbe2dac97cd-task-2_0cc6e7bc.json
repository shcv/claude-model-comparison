  "user_sentiment": "Neutral to slightly frustrated - the user's immediate follow-up with a specific error suggests the changes had a problem, but the tone is pragmatic (requesting investigation and improvement) rather than critical.",

However, the agent did not catch the parsing error that the user immediately encountered after completion.",

  "summary": "Agent completed the requested parser modifications with good structure and tracking, but the work had a latent bug that manifested when the user tested it on real input, requiring investigation and fixes. The task demonstrates competent execution of the stated requirements but misses the practical validation step, resulting in partial completion that now requires debug and remediation work.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is requesting a two-part follow-up: (1) debug investigation of a specific parser error encountered in real usage, and (2) improve error messages for future debugging. This indicates the initial task may have been incomplete or had a subtle bug that testing didn't catch.",
