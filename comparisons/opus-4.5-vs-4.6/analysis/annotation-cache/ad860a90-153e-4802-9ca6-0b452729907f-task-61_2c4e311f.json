  "summary": "The agent took a minimal investigative approach by reading a single file but didn't engage with the actual problem: a hang during NNTP server connection initialization. The user's follow-up with a detailed debugger traceback indicates they needed help understanding and fixing the error, not just file inspection. The agent's response was too shallow and didn't address the core technical issue, leading to misalignment with the user's debugging needs.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User provided a detailed debugger traceback showing the hang occurs during server connection setup. This suggests they were looking for help interpreting the error and finding a solution, not just file inspection.",
