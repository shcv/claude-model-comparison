  "summary": "The agent successfully completed a targeted refactoring task to reorder middleware and generators in the execution pipeline. While the core work was sound and focused, the presence of 4 errors during execution suggests some friction in the implementation process. The user's follow-up question indicates they want deeper architectural understanding rather than approval of the change itself, setting up a second phase of collaborative design work.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is asking for an architectural explanation and wants to understand how the refactored code would generalize to other protocols. This suggests continued exploration and possible additional refactoring work.",
