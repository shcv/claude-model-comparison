  "summary": "The agent successfully implemented schema support and eval mode for Emacs as requested, with solid autonomous execution across 5 touched files. The user's follow-up requesting safety improvements for type conversion functions indicates the core work was well-received, though the request for additional safety measures suggests the initial implementation may have lacked defensive error handling in a few places.",
