  "summary": "The agent independently executed a multi-step configuration integration task involving KVL setup with appropriate file handling and directory structure, but struggled with edit operations (13 errors) and may not have fully completed documentation requirements, as evidenced by the follow-up README request. The work demonstrates good autonomy and scope management but needs refinement in execution quality, particularly around error handling and comprehensive task completion.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is requesting documentation updates, suggesting they either noticed the README wasn't updated during the main task or are moving to the next phase of work. The single-line request format suggests the user expects the agent to know what documentation needs updating.",
