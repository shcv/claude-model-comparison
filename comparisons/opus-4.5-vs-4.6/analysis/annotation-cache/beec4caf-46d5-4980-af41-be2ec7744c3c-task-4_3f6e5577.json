The work was architecturally sound and well-communicated. User's follow-up message indicates partial alignment\u2014they're adding important refinements about the verification workflow's tone and output format (persuasive evidence + tree-structured reporting), suggesting the initial design was a good foundation but incomplete in capturing quality/presentation requirements.",
