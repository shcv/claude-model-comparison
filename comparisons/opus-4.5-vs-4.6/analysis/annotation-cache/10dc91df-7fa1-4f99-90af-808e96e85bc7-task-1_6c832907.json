  "summary": "The agent failed to execute any meaningful work despite two clear requests: first an implicit /init command for codebase analysis, then an explicit request to create a CLAUDE.md file with development commands and documentation. With zero tool calls and zero files touched, the agent did not attempt to analyze the codebase, discover development patterns, or generate the requested documentation file, resulting in complete misalignment with the user's intent.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User escalated from implicit request (/init) to explicit detailed request, indicating the initial response was insufficient. This suggests the user needed the agent to actually perform the analysis and file creation work.",
