  "summary": "The agent conducted extensive codebase exploration to understand project structure and context, which was useful preparation but may have gone beyond the user's immediate request about plan storage location. The 4 errors encountered during execution were recovered from, though the agent appeared to be working somewhat independently of user feedback. User's next message indicates readiness to move to implementation, though it's unclear if the exploration fully satisfied their initial question about plan location.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User shifted from meta-discussion about where to document plans to a concrete implementation request. This suggests either satisfaction with the exploration, or the user simply moving forward regardless of completion status.",
