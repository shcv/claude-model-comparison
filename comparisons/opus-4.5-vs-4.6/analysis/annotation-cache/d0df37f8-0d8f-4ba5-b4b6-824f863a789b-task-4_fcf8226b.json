  "summary": "The agent successfully built a working CLI utility as requested and demonstrated it with sample output, showing good technical execution. However, the underlying BSPL compiler logic didn't handle optional message parameters correctly, generating only one variant of Accept when multiple variants should exist. This represents a partial solution that revealed a deeper issue requiring further iteration on the compiler itself.",
