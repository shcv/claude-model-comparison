  "summary": "The agent successfully diagnosed a GitHub API permission error by reading the relevant script and explaining that the token lacks `repo` scope access. The task was straightforward troubleshooting that matched the user's question, though the session ended without confirmation that the fix resolved the issue or any follow-up iteration.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User likely adjusted GitHub token permissions and moved forward. The empty next_user_message with session_end suggests the answer was sufficient or the user moved on to implementing the fix independently.",
