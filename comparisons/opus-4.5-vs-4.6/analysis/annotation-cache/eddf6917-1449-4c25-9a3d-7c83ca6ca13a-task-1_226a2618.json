  "summary": "The agent provided a competent diagnostic investigation into the laptop's thermal and power management configuration, successfully mapping the landscape of relevant system controls. While the agent didn't definitively solve the overheating issue, it gave the user enough understanding to attempt targeted fixes\u2014demonstrated by their immediate follow-up command to switch power profiles, suggesting good task-to-insight translation despite leaving some investigation incomplete.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is moving from diagnosis to experimentation/remediation by applying a direct configuration change. They're likely testing if forcing performance mode resolves the throttling issue.",
