  "summary": "The agent successfully implemented background settings persistence for zen mode, earning user approval with 'looks good'. However, the implementation introduced or exposed a regression where background pictures stopped working, indicating the core feature logic was sound but integration with the image system needs correction. This represents partial completion requiring follow-up debugging.",
