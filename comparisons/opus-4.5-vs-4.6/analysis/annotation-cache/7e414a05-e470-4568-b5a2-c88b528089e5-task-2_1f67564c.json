  "summary": "Agent successfully entered plan mode, analyzed the codebase to understand the existing bspl adapter's event system architecture, and designed a parallel implementation for the peach adapter with appropriate separation between executor-sourced events (reactions, enablement) and internal custom events. The agent proactively consulted the user on key design decisions (async handling, TypeScript considerations) and was partway through implementation when interrupted, demonstrating good alignment with the stated goal despite not reaching full task completion.",
