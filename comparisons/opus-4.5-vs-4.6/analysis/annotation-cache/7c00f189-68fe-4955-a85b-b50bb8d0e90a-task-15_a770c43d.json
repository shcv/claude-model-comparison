  "user_sentiment": "Neutral to slightly frustrated - the user acknowledged that the bundled version works but points out a specific deficiency (missing button icons), suggesting the previous work was incomplete or missed an important detail.",

While the investigation was thorough, the approach became somewhat scattered with tool usage that didn't clearly lead to identifying the root cause of the missing icons.",

  "summary": "The agent investigated a bundled application issue over an extended session but the investigation didn't resolve the actual problem the user cared about (missing button icons). While the agent was autonomous and persistent, it struggled with error recovery and didn't clearly communicate findings or next steps, leaving the core issue unaddressed and requiring significant iteration.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user identified a specific remaining issue that needs to be addressed: button icons are missing from the bundled version. The next phase would involve investigating why icons aren't being included in the bundle, likely focusing on asset inclusion in the build configuration.",
