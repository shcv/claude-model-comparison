  "summary": "The agent successfully implemented the requested cascading interrupts stress test file with all six scenarios as specified. The work was executed independently with good error recovery when issues arose. The minor misalignment score reflects that while the implementation was delivered and functional, the initial version had errors requiring correction, suggesting the execution could have been more precise on the first attempt.",
