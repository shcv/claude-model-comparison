  "summary": "The agent correctly understood the user's request to add missing action dependencies as 'in' parameters and made appropriate edits to the protocol file. However, the follow-up deadwood detection result suggests the fix may not have fully resolved the underlying protocol issues, indicating either incomplete understanding of the problem scope or that additional iterations are needed. The work was focused but appears to address only part of a larger validation problem.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is now providing additional validation data (deadwood detection results) to assess whether the action dependency fix resolved the underlying protocol issues. This appears to be continuation of the same debugging task rather than satisfaction with the prior work.",
