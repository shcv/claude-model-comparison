  "summary": "Agent successfully executed a complex refactoring task by entering plan mode, designing the reorganization, and implementing both incremental and atomic protocol variants with corresponding agent and proxy versions. The work was well-structured and comprehensive, though 13 errors during execution suggest potential correctness issues that may require user validation. Silent session end indicates likely acceptance, though the errors encountered leave some uncertainty about whether the implementation fully met technical requirements.",
