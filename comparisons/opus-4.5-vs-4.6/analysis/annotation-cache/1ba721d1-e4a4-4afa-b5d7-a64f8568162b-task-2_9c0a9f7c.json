  "summary": "The agent conducted a systematic search for demos using Glob and Grep to discover relevant files and directories, then attempted to run them via Bash. However, multiple errors (likely file-not-found or permission issues) occurred during execution, and the user interrupted before the agent could complete the verification or communicate findings. The core misalignment appears to be that either the demos weren't where the agent looked or the execution approach wasn't working as expected, leaving the task incomplete.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "Task was interrupted by user, suggesting either confusion about where demos are located, frustration with the discovery process taking too long, or the user finding what they needed elsewhere.",
