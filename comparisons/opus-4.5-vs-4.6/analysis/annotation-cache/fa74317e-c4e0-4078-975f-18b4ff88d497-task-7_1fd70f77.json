  "summary": "Agent appropriately delegated a codebase exploration task to a subagent to investigate session management. However, the interaction was interrupted before the exploration completed or results were synthesized. The user's abrupt pivot to a new feature request suggests either satisfaction with the prior work or a context switch, but the incomplete follow-up message and lack of acknowledgment make alignment assessment uncertain.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User abruptly shifted from architectural exploration to requesting a significant feature change (multi-backend support). The incomplete follow-up message ('if we're not using the claude...') suggests the user may have been interrupted or changed context mid-sentence.",
