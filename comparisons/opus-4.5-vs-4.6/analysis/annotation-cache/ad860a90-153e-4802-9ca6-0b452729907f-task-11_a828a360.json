However, the follow-up message reveals the user encountered a blocking performance issue when using the script, suggesting either incomplete context about requirements or a legitimate edge case the initial discussion didn't address. The work was well-executed but apparently didn't fully solve the user's underlying problem.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User tested the newly created script, discovered a performance/blocking issue with email syncing, and returned with a more specific technical problem. This is typical iteration: initial task approval followed by discovery of related issues during real use.",
