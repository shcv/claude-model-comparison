While the core tracing work was completed, three edit errors during the process indicated some execution friction. The user's next message pivoting to GitHub issue research suggests they found the investigation sufficiently informative to validate their hypothesis externally.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is shifting from internal code investigation to external validation by searching GitHub issues. This suggests the agent provided enough information for the user to form a hypothesis that now needs cross-checking before filing new issues.",
