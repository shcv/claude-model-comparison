The user's terse 'push it' suggests they expected autonomous execution of the full release workflow. While the changelog was populated correctly and commits were made, the task required explicit reiteration to complete the final publication step, indicating partial misalignment with the user's expectation for end-to-end task completion.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User's brief 'push it' command after initial work suggests they expected the full task (including push) to be completed in the first request, indicating they may have wanted more autonomous execution without waiting for intermediate confirmation.",
