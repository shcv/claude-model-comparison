  "summary": "This task captures a brief confirmation moment followed by a pivot to a new request. The agent executed minimal work during the confirmation phase (2 Bash calls in 28 seconds with no file modifications), which appears appropriate for a simple affirmation. However, alignment is moderate because the 'yes' response lacked explicit confirmation of what was being agreed to, and the immediate follow-up request suggests the user may not have received the expected outcome or clarity from that interaction.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User proceeded with a new, more specific request (fetch current issues) after a one-word confirmation, suggesting the prior context was accepted and they're moving forward with concrete actions.",
