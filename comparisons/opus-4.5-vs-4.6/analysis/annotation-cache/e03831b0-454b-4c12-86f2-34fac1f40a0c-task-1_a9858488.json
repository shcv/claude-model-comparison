  "summary": "The agent built a functional Emacs mode with proper structure and syntax highlighting, but implemented type inference behavior that directly contradicts the user's stated specification. While the agent recovered from edit errors during implementation, the fundamental misalignment on type inference (adding unspecified functionality) represents a significant gap between delivered work and intended design. The task is technically complete but requires correction.",
