  "summary": "This was a design discussion task where the user sought detailed analysis of variant generation rules for a linguistic project. The agent appears to have engaged in conversation but took no concrete actions (no code, files, or tool calls). The user's follow-up message shows they're actively iterating and refining the approach together, but the incomplete message suggests the conversation was cut off mid-session, leaving the task partially addressed rather than resolved.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is narrowing scope (from options 1 and 3 to just option 1) and continuing collaborative refinement. The incomplete final message suggests the user was mid-thought or interrupted, indicating active iterative work.",
