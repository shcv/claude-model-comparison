  "summary": "The agent successfully implemented the requested architectural changes to the submit system, moving validation logic server-side and establishing an atomic, sequential submission model with proper outcome handling. Multiple edit errors occurred during implementation but were systematically recovered, suggesting the agent understood the requirements but struggled with execution precision. The user's immediate commit request indicates acceptance, though the number of corrections needed suggests minor misalignment in initial implementation approach.",
