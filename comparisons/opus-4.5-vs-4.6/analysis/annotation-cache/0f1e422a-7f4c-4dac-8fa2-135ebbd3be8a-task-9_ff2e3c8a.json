  "summary": "The agent misinterpreted a vague request and performed extensive manual changelog/diff work through file editing, when the user actually meant to run an automated sync tool. The corrective follow-up message reveals a fundamental misalignment: the agent did not ask for clarification on an ambiguous request and instead chose a labor-intensive manual approach. The task demonstrates poor intent recognition despite reasonable execution of the chosen approach.",
