  "summary": "The agent successfully completed a codebase exploration task to understand the peach implementation as an alternative to bspl, executing a focused investigation with minimal scope creep. The user's positive follow-up ('yes, sketch the integration') indicates approval, though the 4 errors encountered during tool execution suggest minor friction. The work was well-aligned with the user's intent to evaluate this alternative approach, positioning the next phase of design and interface definition.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user is progressing from evaluation to design: they've accepted the peach direction and are now asking for architectural sketching and interface design work. This signals movement from research/exploration to implementation planning.",
