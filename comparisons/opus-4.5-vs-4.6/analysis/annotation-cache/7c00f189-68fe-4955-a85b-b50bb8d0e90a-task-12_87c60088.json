However, the user's follow-up reveals the real issue\u2014the app still hangs after installation\u2014indicating a significant misalignment between the requested task (script extraction) and the user's underlying goal (fixing the hanging app). This suggests the agent should have investigated why the app was hanging rather than just automating existing steps.",
