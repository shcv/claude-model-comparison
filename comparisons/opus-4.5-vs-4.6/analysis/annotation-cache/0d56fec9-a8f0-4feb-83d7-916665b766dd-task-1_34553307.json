  "summary": "The agent correctly identified the need for debugging infrastructure and began adding logging to trace agent interactions, but the user's follow-up revealed that the underlying architectural concern\u2014how agents communicate and whether locks are necessary\u2014wasn't addressed. The agent focused on a narrow solution (logging) without exploring whether the hanging was a design flaw in the synchronization model, which the user's mention of 'safe queues' and streaming suggests may be the real issue.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user redirected focus from the immediate logging solution to fundamental design questions about streaming behavior and threading model, suggesting the agent may have been solving a symptom rather than understanding the root cause.",
