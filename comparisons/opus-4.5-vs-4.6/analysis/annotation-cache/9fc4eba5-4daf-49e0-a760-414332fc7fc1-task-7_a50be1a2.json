The user's immediate follow-up with a technical correction suggests the explanation conflated filtering and overwriting logic, indicating moderate misalignment with the user's actual understanding of the system. Further iteration will be needed to align on the correct logic.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user is providing a technical correction that identifies a logical issue. This typically leads to either: (1) the agent re-examining the code with this filter-vs-overwrite distinction in mind, or (2) the agent discussing implementation options with the user to resolve the misalignment.",
