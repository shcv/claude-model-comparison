  "summary": "The agent conducted exploratory investigation into webhook async updates as a follow-up to the initial demo discussion, but the partial completion and shift to a new requirement (cleanup behavior) suggests the work didn't fully resolve the user's inquiry. The user's next message indicates they're ready to move toward implementation details, though alignment on the webhook feature mechanics may still need clarification.",
