  "summary": "The agent attempted a changelog generation task but did not produce a completed changelog document despite 301 seconds of investigation involving 111 tool calls. The session ended without visible deliverables or user confirmation, suggesting either procedural confusion about how to locate version information in the codebase or inability to synthesize findings into the requested format. The extensive tool usage without demonstrated output indicates the agent may have struggled with approach or scope clarity.",
