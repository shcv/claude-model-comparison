  "summary": "The agent successfully executed all four requested operations (commit, push, deploy Forgejo, cleanup) on remote infrastructure with proper verification. The work was autonomous and focused, following user instructions directly without scope expansion. The empty follow-up message and session end suggest the user was satisfied with the outcome, though slight uncertainty remains due to the nature of async infrastructure tasks.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "Session ended without additional user input, consistent with a completed infrastructure task where results are immediately visible or the user is monitoring separately.",
