  "summary": "Agent successfully investigated parallel execution patterns through iterative code refinement and testing. While the initial task completion was partial (preparation work rather than full analysis), the user's next message shows satisfaction with the direction and requests natural extensions rather than corrections. The agent demonstrated good autonomy and error recovery, staying focused on the core investigation.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User building on initial exploration by requesting additional dimensions, full dataset execution, and formatted reporting. This indicates iterative refinement of analysis rather than course correction.",
