However, the implementation was cut short\u2014only basic scaffolding (fixtures, test utilities) was written before the session ended, leaving the core headless Emacs client integration and actual test cases unimplemented. The planning was sound and well-communicated, but the user's follow-up silence and incomplete implementation suggest potential misalignment on whether planning alone was sufficient or if hands-on implementation was expected to continue.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User's empty next message with session termination suggests either satisfaction with the planning phase alone, or they are evaluating the scaffolding before continuing work themselves. No explicit approval or concerns were raised.",
