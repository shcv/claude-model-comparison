The user's follow-up reveals they wanted deeper code-level analysis of reception ordering enforcement and the 'safe' events heuristic, not just output comparison. Significant iteration would be needed to reach the actual bug.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is asking progressively more specific questions about where reception ordering is enforced, whether tangling marks are applied, and whether the 'safe' events heuristic is interfering. This suggests the agent's diagnostic output didn't clarify the root cause, and the user is now guiding toward the actual bug.",
