The user's immediate follow-up request to add a new feature suggests satisfaction with the initial deliverable, though the quick pivot to development work rather than feedback on the documentation implies the documentation may have been adequate but not exceptional.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "Feature expansion request. The user moved from documentation/setup work to a functional feature request (unique prefix support for feedback selection), indicating they're now ready to develop and view the initial analysis as complete or adequate.",
