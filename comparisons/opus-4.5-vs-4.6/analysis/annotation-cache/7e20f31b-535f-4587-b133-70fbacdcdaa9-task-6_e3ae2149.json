  "summary": "The agent explored Firefox's notification system but encountered errors that limited the investigation's success. The user's follow-up indicates the initial approach (minibuffer messages) missed their actual need for audible/tangible feedback, suggesting a misalignment between investigating existing notification infrastructure and providing the desired solution of playing an actual sound tone.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is redirecting the agent toward a more practical solution - generating or playing an audible tone rather than relying on subtle notification methods. This suggests the user wants tangible audio feedback rather than visual/textual cues.",
