  "summary": "The agent tackled app startup optimization but with incomplete success. While it systematically investigated the issue and made targeted code changes to reduce initialization overhead, the work didn't fully resolve the startup delay problem (evidenced by the user discovering the popup issue). The agent recovered from multiple edit errors but could have been more precise in execution, and the alignment was partial since the root startup issue persisted despite the optimization attempts.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user shifted to a different but related issue (battery optimization popup not navigating correctly), suggesting they tested the prior work and found it partially successful but incomplete. This is typical continuation of a multi-part optimization session.",
