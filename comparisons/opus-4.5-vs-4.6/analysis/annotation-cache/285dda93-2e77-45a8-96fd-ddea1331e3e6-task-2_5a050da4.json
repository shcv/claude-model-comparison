  "summary": "The agent received a clear architectural reorganization request but failed to engage with it, taking no tools or actions despite straightforward instructions to simplify the codebase structure. The truncated repeat message from the user indicates the request likely did not register, requiring re-submission and renewed attempt to execute the requested work.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User likely expected the agent to begin exploring the codebase, ask clarifying questions about the proposed reorganization, or start implementing the changes. The truncated repeat message suggests the user is re-submitting after no response.",
