  "summary": "The agent successfully refactored the UI to use shared tree view components across category and location views, removing count badges and establishing the visual foundation. However, it didn't fully understand or implement the interaction model change where long-press should trigger drag/drop instead of navigation to details, which was core to the user's request about 'actions can be different.' This represents partial alignment with a clear behavioral gap that needs correction.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User identified a blocking issue with the interaction model. Expected: agent will fix the long-press behavior to activate drag/drop instead of navigation, likely requiring changes to gesture handlers or event routing.",
