  "user_sentiment": "neutral to uncertain - the next message indicates session continuation/context loss rather than explicit approval or criticism",
  "sentiment_confidence": "low",
  "execution_quality": "The agent executed the task methodically by reading relevant context files before making changes, though 3 errors were encountered during execution suggesting potential issues with the implementation or environment.",
  "work_category": "Code refactoring continuation task where the agent updated an incremental mapping system to align with a previously refactored protocol. The work involved reading context from multiple files and rewriting a specific module.",
  "scope_management": "focused - agent stayed narrowly on the requested mapping update without apparent scope creep",
  "communication_quality": "adequate - agent documented its actions through tool use but the error details are opaque from this summary",
  "error_recovery": "struggled - 3 errors were encountered but the summary lacks detail on whether they were resolved or worked around",
  "iteration_required": "significant - session continuation indicates prior iteration and current errors suggest further debugging will be needed",
  "task_completion": "partial - the agent wrote the updated mapping code, but errors during execution and lack of validation suggest the work may not have been fully verified",
  "alignment_score": 3,
  "summary": "Agent addressed a refactoring continuation task by updating incremental mapping code to match a new protocol. While the approach was methodical and focused, three execution errors and the abrupt session end due to context limits suggest the implementation may need verification and debugging before considering the task fully complete.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "Session ended with context exhaustion; unclear if user confirmed the changes or encountered issues with the rewritten code. Follow-up would likely involve testing the refactored mapping or addressing any runtime errors.",
  "autonomy_level": "medium - agent read supporting context independently but the 3 errors suggest it may have needed clarification or encountered unexpected constraints",
