The user's follow-up message proposing a global state implementation indicates satisfaction with the work and a desire to expand its scope, demonstrating the agent's execution matched the initial intent precisely.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User immediately provided an expanded architectural request building on the completed work, indicating satisfaction with the implementation and desire to evolve it further. This suggests the toggle works correctly and the user wants to refactor its scope to be global rather than local.",
