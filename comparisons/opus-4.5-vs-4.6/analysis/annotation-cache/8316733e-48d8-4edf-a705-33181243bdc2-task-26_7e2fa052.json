The 'ok, what's next?' response suggests the user accepted the work and is ready to proceed, though the minimal prior context and errors encountered (recovered) indicate this was a continuation task rather than a standalone feature. Minor misalignment is possible since the agent's specific commit message or scope wasn't visible in this snapshot.",
