  "summary": "The agent executed a push command without verifying or handling prerequisite steps (version bumping, issue referencing) that the user expected to be completed beforehand. The user's follow-up indicates misalignment between the agent's interpretation of 'pushed' as merely executing the git command versus the user's expectation of a complete pre-push workflow. This represents a significant gap in understanding the full scope of what should constitute a release/push operation.",
