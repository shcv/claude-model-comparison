  "user_sentiment": "Neutral to uncertain - the empty next message with session_end suggests either task abandonment, context limitations, or the user observing the agent's progress without explicit approval. The 7 errors encountered and TaskStop call indicate potential frustration or intervention.",

  "execution_quality": "The agent methodically followed the plan, reading existing configuration, creating appropriate directory structures, and writing necessary scripts. However, the session ended abruptly (possibly due to timeout or user stopping the task) before completing full validation and cleanup phases of the migration.",

The agent executed the plan by analyzing the current config structure, creating Stow package directories, and writing migration infrastructure.",

  "summary": "The agent began solid execution of a multi-phase infrastructure migration plan, reading the existing config structure and starting to implement Stow-based package directories. However, the work encountered multiple errors during execution and was interrupted mid-task, leaving the migration incomplete. The abrupt session end without user feedback makes it unclear whether the agent's approach aligned with the user's expectations or if external factors caused the session to terminate.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User likely either: (1) paused to review agent's work before continuing, (2) encountered context/performance issues requiring session restart, or (3) decided to take the work in a different direction. The incomplete state suggests iteration or refinement will be needed.",
