  "summary": "The agent successfully implemented the structural changes for sub-tab navigation across multiple files, working autonomously with good task management. However, the implementation missed or incompletely addressed animation/transition details that were likely implicit in the original plan, requiring user follow-up to refine visual behavior. The moderate scope and systematic approach were appropriate, but execution gaps in animation implementation reduced alignment with user's full intent.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is requesting refinement of animation behavior - specifically requesting sliding indicators instead of fading, and synchronized movement of tab bars with page transitions. This suggests the core structure was implemented but visual polish/animation details were missed or incomplete.",
