  "summary": "The agent successfully implemented the requested Go hook binary with Unix socket and TCP support, completing all specified requirements. The work involved significant iteration with 10 error encounters that were systematically resolved, and the user's follow-up question indicates they are engaged in code review rather than dissatisfied with the outcome. The slight misalignment is likely due to implementation details that weren't fully specified initially, requiring the agent to make reasonable design decisions.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is asking a technical clarification question about Go flag syntax, suggesting they are reviewing the code and want to understand implementation details rather than indicating dissatisfaction.",
