  "summary": "The agent investigated the user's three reported issues (notify-send timeout, yubikey toast persistence, duplicate events) through research and exploration but did not propose or implement fixes. The user's minimal response suggests the investigation may not have fully addressed what was needed, leaving the core problems unresolved and requiring further iteration to determine the actual desired outcome.",
