  "user_sentiment": "Neutral to slightly positive, with a shift toward architectural evaluation. The user's follow-up question about refactoring/unifying summarizer variants and dropping non-SDK version suggests they're satisfied enough with the current work to move on to a larger refactoring discussion.",

  "execution_quality": "The agent successfully implemented the requested feature with multiple iterations to refine the output format. However, 8 edit errors suggest the implementation required significant debugging and rework to get the consolidation logic correct.",
  "work_category": "Code refactoring task to consolidate redundant tool calls in summarization output. The user requested compacting repeated file operations into unified entries with per-file summaries rather than listing every individual tool invocation.",

The work was appropriately scoped to the user's request, though the high error count during implementation suggests the solution required substantial refinement. User's pivot to architectural questions indicates satisfaction with the feature, prompting a discussion about larger codebase consolidation decisions.",
