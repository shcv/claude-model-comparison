  "user_sentiment": "Neutral to unclear. The initial message 'yes, make the changes' approved the work, but the session ended with 'Request interrupted by user'\u2014suggesting either the user stopped the session deliberately or there was a system interruption.",

  "summary": "The agent actively worked through a series of code edits with a clear plan (tracked via todos) but encountered frequent errors (15 total) that required ongoing recovery effort. While the agent persisted independently and stayed focused on the stated task, the high error rate and session interruption suggest the work was not cleanly completed. The low alignment score reflects uncertainty about whether the final state matched the user's intent, given the interrupted conclusion.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "Session terminated mid-task. With 561 seconds of work and an interruption message, the user likely stopped the session deliberately or encountered a system issue. No explicit feedback on completion quality was given.",
