  "summary": "The agent successfully executed a careful backup and investigation workflow for the user's configuration management migration project. Work was well-organized and safety-conscious, though there was minor misalignment in the depth of technical investigation versus the user's stated need for 'careful' approach (asking questions rather than proceeding with discovery). The session appears to have concluded with all requested backup and initial investigation tasks completed.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "Session ended without follow-up message, suggesting the agent completed the requested information-gathering phase. User will likely review the findings and initiate the next phase of configuration migration.",
