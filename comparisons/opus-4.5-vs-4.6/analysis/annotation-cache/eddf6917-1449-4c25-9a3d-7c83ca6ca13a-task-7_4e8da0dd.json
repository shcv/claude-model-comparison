  "summary": "Agent successfully conducted research on battery replacement difficulty using web search and information gathering, executing the investigation phase autonomously. However, alignment is partial because the initial request was ambiguous about which machine type to investigate, so the research may not have targeted the user's specific device. The follow-up 'go ahead and reconfigure' indicates the user is satisfied enough to proceed to the next phase, though it's unclear if the agent's research directly informed this decision.",
