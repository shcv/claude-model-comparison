  "summary": "Agent successfully completed a multi-component feature to add app-based activity categorization with hierarchical selection. Planning phase established clear architecture, implementation was systematic and tracked via TodoWrite, and errors during migrations were resolved. Minor ambiguity around exact UI behavior (handling of pre-selected vs unselected defaults) suggests slightly imperfect initial alignment, though core feature was delivered as requested.",
