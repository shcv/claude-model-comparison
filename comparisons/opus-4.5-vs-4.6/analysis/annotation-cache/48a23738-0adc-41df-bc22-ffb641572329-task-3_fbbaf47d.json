The user's brief affirmation ('yes') combined with the new directive suggests the diagnostic work was on track, but the task remains incomplete pending implementation of the package modification.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user affirmed the solution approach ('yes') and gave a clear next directive to add the fix to packages.el, indicating they want the work continued or completed. This suggests the initial diagnosis was correct but implementation was incomplete.",
