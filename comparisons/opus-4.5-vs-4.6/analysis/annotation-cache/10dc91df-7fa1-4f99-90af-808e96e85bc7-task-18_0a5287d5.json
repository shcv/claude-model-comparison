Two edits were attempted with one encountering errors, and the session was interrupted before the user could verify the changes worked correctly. The work was focused and well-intentioned but incomplete verification prevents confirmation of successful implementation.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "Session continuation indicates unfinished work. The user's next message appears truncated ('Analysis: Let me analyze...' suggests auto-generated summary), implying the conversation ran out of context before task completion could be verified.",
