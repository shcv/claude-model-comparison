  "summary": "The agent competently executed intermediate task management (stopping and cleaning up a team investigation), but the prior astdiff analysis appears to have timed out or produced inconclusive results, leading the user to request a retry with longer tolerance plus a secondary code review task. The agent is well-positioned to execute the new dual-track request but shows partial alignment with the initial investigation goals.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User expects the agent to: (1) retry astdiff with significantly extended timeout (5-10 minutes), (2) regardless of outcome, examine the astdiff codebase and produce a report on potential improvements. This is a bifurcated task with fallback paths.",
