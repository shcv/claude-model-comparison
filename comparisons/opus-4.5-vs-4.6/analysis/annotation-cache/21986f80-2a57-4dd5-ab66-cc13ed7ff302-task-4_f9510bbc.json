  "summary": "The agent launched a multi-agent investigation into protocol verification but did not clearly surface the actual constraint (Quote's out ID vs Request_Item's missing out ID). The user independently identified the real issue in their follow-up, indicating the subagent work did not target the right problem area. While execution was autonomous and error-free, the investigation was misaligned with what would actually resolve the user's concern about terminal states.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user pivoted to their own analysis and identified the actual architectural constraint blocking the protocol. This suggests they either lost confidence in the subagent approach or reached their own conclusions independently. Next would likely be design work to enable Request_Item before protocol start.",
