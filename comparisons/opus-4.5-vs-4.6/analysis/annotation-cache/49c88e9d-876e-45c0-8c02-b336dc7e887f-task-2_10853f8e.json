  "summary": "The agent conducted a competent investigation into the duplicate submission issue by examining the sync tool, post tool, mcron schedule, and task wrapper code, making targeted fixes to prevent race conditions. However, the follow-up cleanup instruction was ambiguous ('old files' was not clearly scoped), and the partial task completion suggests the agent may not have fully addressed what the user intended in the cleanup phase.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User gave a direct cleanup instruction after investigation, suggesting they were ready to move to the remediation phase. The brevity suggests confidence in the agent's understanding but potential ambiguity about scope.",
