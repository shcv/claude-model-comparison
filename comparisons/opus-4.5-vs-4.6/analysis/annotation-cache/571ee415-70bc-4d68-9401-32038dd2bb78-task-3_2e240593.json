While the user explicitly asked to 'see if I can get any to trigger' and the agent found that non-existent models were being accepted without error, the agent appears to have not adequately investigated this serious validation bug. The user's skeptical response indicates the implementation doesn't meet their actual need for a reliable model-switching mechanism, requiring further investigation and fixes before the task can be considered complete.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is questioning the reliability of the implementation and expecting the agent to investigate the false-success bug where invalid models are accepted. The 'also' suggests continuation of the same debugging session rather than a new task.",
