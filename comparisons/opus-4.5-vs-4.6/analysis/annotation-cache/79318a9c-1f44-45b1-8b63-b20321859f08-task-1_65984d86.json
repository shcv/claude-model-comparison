  "summary": "Agent made meaningful progress on the first part of a multi-phase task (paper organization and symlinking), but the incomplete user request and abrupt session termination left the core work incomplete. The agent encountered errors during execution but recovered, though without clear direction on the extension blocks portion, alignment with the user's full intent is uncertain. The truncated request and empty follow-up suggest either user dissatisfaction, technical interruption, or abandonment of this line of work.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User message abruptly ended with 'but for commitments an' - likely a typo or incomplete thought. Session end with no follow-up suggests either the user abandoned the task, the interface was closed, or they chose not to continue.",
