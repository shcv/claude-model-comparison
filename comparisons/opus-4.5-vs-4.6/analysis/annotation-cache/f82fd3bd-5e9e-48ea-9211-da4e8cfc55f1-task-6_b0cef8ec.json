The resulting output remained in the 50k range (unwanted), and edit errors suggest the implementation was flawed. The user's pivot to requesting /iterate with hypothesis tracking indicates they want a more disciplined, documented approach to actually solve the underlying problem rather than make surface-level changes.",
