  "user_sentiment": "Inferred as curious/clarifying rather than satisfied. The follow-up question 'explain the Typed Bridge - where is it used and why?' suggests the user wants to understand the implementation details, which could indicate either confusion about what was actually implemented or a desire to validate correctness before proceeding.",
  "sentiment_confidence": "medium",
  "execution_quality": "The agent systematically read existing code, created a task breakdown, and began implementing changes with proper tool usage and file management. However, 23 errors were encountered during execution, suggesting either incomplete implementation or debugging challenges that may not have been fully resolved.",
  "work_category": "Implementation of a major refactoring plan to simplify a proxy agent architecture and add typed validation layers. The user provided a detailed multi-phase plan and the agent worked through implementing the first phase while preparing groundwork for subsequent phases.",

  "summary": "The agent made substantial progress on a complex multi-phase refactoring plan, demonstrating good autonomy and systematic approach. However, the 23 errors encountered and the user's follow-up question seeking clarification on a key component suggests the implementation may be incomplete or unclear, requiring significant iteration before the work can be considered truly complete.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user is asking for explanation of a specific component, suggesting they want to understand the work done before proceeding or making decisions about the next phase. This is typical iteration pattern for complex refactoring work.",
