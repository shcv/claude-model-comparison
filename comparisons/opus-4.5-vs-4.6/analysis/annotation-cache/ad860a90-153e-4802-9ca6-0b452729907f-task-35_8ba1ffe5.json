The user explicitly stated the attempted solution wasn't working and provided diagnostic output, but the agent never reached the point of analyzing the issue or proposing next steps. The incomplete initial response left the problem unresolved.",

Expected follow-up: agent should diagnose why the password caching wasn't preventing subsequent touches, or propose a different approach.",
