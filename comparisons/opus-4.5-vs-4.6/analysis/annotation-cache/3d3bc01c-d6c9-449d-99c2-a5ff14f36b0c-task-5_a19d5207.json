However, the user's immediate follow-up reveals the agent should have also moved the sync_server property as part of the same architectural shift, indicating partial rather than complete alignment with the intended design change.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User provided clarification that both batch_interval AND sync_server should be MAS properties, not just batch_interval. This suggests the agent solved part of the problem but missed a related configuration that should have been moved simultaneously.",
