However, the discovery that 'flutter run doesn't use our commit count' indicates the underlying issue wasn't fully addressed\u2014the user's follow-up suggests this was an observation rather than resolution. The work was well-executed as checking/verification but fell short of achieving the actual goal of ensuring commit count integration works properly.",
