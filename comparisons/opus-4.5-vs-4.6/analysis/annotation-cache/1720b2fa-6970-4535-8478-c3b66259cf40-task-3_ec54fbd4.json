  "work_category": "Code investigation and explanation task where the agent explored a codebase to understand synchronous execution semantics and distinguish between 'S' and 'P' states using a 'pending' flag. The work involved reading existing code, identifying relevant files, and providing clarification on implementation details.",

  "summary": "The agent competently investigated code structure and constraints around synchronous execution and state management but appeared to miss or under-explain an important architectural component (the in-memory store) that the user subsequently asked about. The work was focused and methodical, but alignment was partial because the follow-up question indicates the user's actual concern\u2014testing with in-memory implementations\u2014wasn't adequately addressed in the initial explanation.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is drilling deeper into architectural details (in-memory vs SQLite store compatibility) rather than moving to new work, indicating the prior explanation was a starting point that raised new questions about implementation correctness and testing strategy.",
