However, 8 errors encountered (likely permission or tool usage issues) suggest some inefficiency in the execution approach, though the agent recovered to complete the investigation.",

  "summary": "The agent successfully completed a codebase investigation and proposal task, exploring the repository structure and goals to suggest meaningful experiments. The user's immediate selection of 'experiment 2' demonstrates strong alignment with expectations. Despite some tool execution errors that were recovered from, the agent delivered exactly what was requested without scope creep.",
