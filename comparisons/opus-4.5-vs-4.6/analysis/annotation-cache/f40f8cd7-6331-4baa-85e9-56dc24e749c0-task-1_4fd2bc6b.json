  "summary": "The agent began a systematic troubleshooting approach with appropriate diagnostic commands but didn't complete the investigation or synthesize findings into actionable insights before the user provided additional constraints. The user's follow-up clarifies that hardware failure (cable/power) is unlikely and narrows focus to the port, suggesting the initial investigation may not have addressed the most relevant areas. The task requires iteration to align with the user's emerging understanding of the problem.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User provided additional context about the hardware (built-in cable, shared power supply working on Windows) and narrowed focus to port-level issues, indicating they want the investigation to continue in a more targeted direction.",
