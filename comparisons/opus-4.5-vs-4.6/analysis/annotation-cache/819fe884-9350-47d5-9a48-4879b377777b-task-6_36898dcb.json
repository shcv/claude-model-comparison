  "summary": "The agent performed a reasonable code exploration to understand the current implementation but appears to have been moving toward feature implementation when the user only wanted documentation and issue tracking at this stage. The agent correctly responded to the clarification and stayed focused on exploration rather than editing, but the initial mismatch suggests incomplete understanding of the user's intent to defer implementation planning.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User redirected the agent away from implementation toward documentation/issue creation. This suggests the agent may have been preparing to implement the feature, but the user wanted to scope down and plan first.",
