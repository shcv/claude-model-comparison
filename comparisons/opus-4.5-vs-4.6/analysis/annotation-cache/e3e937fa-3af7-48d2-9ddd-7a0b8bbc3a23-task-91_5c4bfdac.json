  "summary": "The agent attempted research into SSH agent service module patterns but may have misread the user's intent. The user's follow-up question suggests they either doubt the efficacy of web search for this problem or expected the agent to investigate existing Guix/NixOS service modules directly rather than general implementation patterns. The agent's approach was technically sound but potentially misaligned with the user's underlying need.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is questioning the research approach itself, asking whether others have actually done this (suggesting doubt about the feasibility or appropriateness of web search). This indicates the user may prefer a different approach - possibly examining existing service modules in the codebase or Guix ecosystem directly rather than general web research.",
