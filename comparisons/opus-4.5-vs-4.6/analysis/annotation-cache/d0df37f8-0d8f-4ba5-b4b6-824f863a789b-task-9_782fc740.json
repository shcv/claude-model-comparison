Multiple edit errors and the user's follow-up request for subagent-driven rule-by-rule verification indicate the initial approach lacked the systematic depth needed. The agent showed recovery capability but did not fully align with the user's underlying need for confident correctness validation.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User explicitly requested subagent-driven investigation of individual rules from the paper, indicating they want systematic, parallel verification of each implementation rule rather than a single monolithic analysis pass. This suggests the initial execution did not sufficiently validate correctness.",
