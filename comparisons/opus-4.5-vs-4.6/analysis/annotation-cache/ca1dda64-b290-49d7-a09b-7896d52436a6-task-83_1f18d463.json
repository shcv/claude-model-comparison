Despite making edits, the test command failed with a clear error about missing openwakeword dependencies, indicating the agent either didn't understand the actual requirement or made incomplete changes. Significant iteration would be needed to diagnose and fix the root cause.",

Follow-up would likely involve either installing dependencies, debugging the import/model loading, or clarifying requirements.",
