  "summary": "The agent tackled a technically complex migration task with focused scope and high autonomy, systematically working through multiple file edits. The high number of errors (10) during execution and lack of user validation suggests the work may not be production-ready, or the user may have encountered issues during testing that weren't communicated back. The partial completion rating reflects uncertainty whether all refactoring objectives were fully achieved given the error count.",
