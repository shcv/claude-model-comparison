The user's immediate pivot to 'write the script' suggests either the research answered their questions sufficiently or they're ready to move beyond analysis. The partial alignment score reflects that while the task was executed efficiently, the user's follow-up indicates they may have needed more actionable output (e.g., a script template or configuration recommendation).",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User pivoted to a concrete implementation request ('write the script and push it to skyhook'), suggesting they either: (1) got the information they needed and are ready to proceed, or (2) the research findings were insufficient and they're moving forward with their own plan.",
