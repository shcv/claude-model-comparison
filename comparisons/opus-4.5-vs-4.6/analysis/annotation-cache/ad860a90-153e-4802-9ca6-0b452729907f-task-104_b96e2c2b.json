  "summary": "The agent did not execute any work during this task\u2014no code was touched, read, or analyzed. The user asked whether code should be refactored into a module; instead of proactively exploring the codebase and recommending a strategy, the agent appears to have engaged passively in discussion. The user then provided explicit direction in the follow-up, indicating the agent had not adequately addressed the architectural question. This represents a significant gap between what the user needed (concrete refactoring recommendations) and what was delivered.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User pivoted from asking if refactoring was needed to giving concrete direction: extract into a module, remove the 'shcv' prefix, organize into a directory structure. This suggests the agent may not have clearly recommended a path forward, prompting the user to specify the direction themselves.",
