The user's cryptic initial statement ('it doesn't have that key yet') lacked sufficient context for the agent to understand the underlying problem, resulting in clarification attempts rather than meaningful progress. The user's pivot to asking about key-pushing scripts suggests the initial interaction missed their actual intent, indicating misalignment between what the user was trying to accomplish and what the agent understood.",
