However, the work was only partially aligned with the user's underlying problem\u2014they had an immediately actionable issue (NCSU account locked out) where research on OAuth setup was less relevant than finding workarounds or alternative authentication methods. The user's follow-up question about OAMA suggests they're exploring alternatives rather than fully satisfied with OAuth configuration guidance.",
