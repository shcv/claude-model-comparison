  "user_sentiment": "Neutral to curious - the follow-up question 'why is it named async_.py?' suggests the user noticed something unexpected or potentially problematic about the naming convention, rather than expressing satisfaction or criticism.",

  "execution_quality": "The agent made substantial progress on a complex refactoring task, touching 17 files and implementing the core MAS ID concept with role bindings. However, 17 errors were encountered during execution, and the next user question about naming suggests the agent may not have fully optimized or explained some implementation choices.",
  "work_category": "Refactoring agent configuration system to adopt a multi-agent system (MAS) ID pattern with role-based agent mappings, similar to an existing reference codebase. This involved updating example files, executor implementations, and initialization logic across the project.",

  "summary": "The agent undertook a substantial refactoring to introduce MAS ID-based agent configuration across multiple files, demonstrating high autonomy and appropriate scope. However, the high error count (17) and the user's immediate follow-up question about naming conventions suggests implementation details may not fully align with the user's mental model of how the system should be structured, requiring clarification and likely further refinement.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user is asking a clarifying question about a specific implementation choice (the async_.py filename), likely wanting to understand the reasoning or possibly indicating this doesn't match their intended pattern. This is typical iteration where the user validates details of what was implemented.",
