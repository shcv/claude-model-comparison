The user requested design guidance for making a verification workflow persuasive through evidence and code walkthroughs; the agent appears to have created or modified skills/templates without clarifying what was actually needed. The immediate follow-up question about missing skills suggests the implementation didn't work or wasn't what the user expected, indicating significant intent-execution gap.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User's follow-up question ('where are these skills?') indicates the agent created something that didn't address the actual request or wasn't integrated correctly. This likely triggered a debugging/clarification cycle.",
