  "summary": "The agent investigated API cost information and caching as requested, but the user's immediate redirection to TUI modes and commands suggests this wasn't the priority work they wanted done. While technically sound, the agent failed to recognize the user was clarifying context rather than requesting immediate implementation of those features. The follow-up message shows the user had to explicitly state what should be built next, indicating a significant gap between the agent's understanding and the user's actual intent.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User immediately pivoted to a new, more specific request (adding modes to TUI and /commands), suggesting the prior work wasn't what they wanted to focus on. The 'no, that's fine' dismissal followed by 'Let's add...' indicates the agent should have moved to implementing TUI features instead.",
