However, the initial implementation appears to have been incomplete or insufficient, as the user's follow-up immediately requests more detailed output\u2014suggesting the initial demo didn't fully satisfy the stated goal of 'confirming what the server sent back.' The work demonstrates good troubleshooting but partial alignment with the user's actual requirements.",
