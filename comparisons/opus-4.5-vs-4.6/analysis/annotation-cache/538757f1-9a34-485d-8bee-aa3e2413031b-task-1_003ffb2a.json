  "summary": "The agent performed a requested deep investigation with focused scope but encountered multiple errors that likely prevented comprehensive findings. The user's immediate follow-up requesting 'fixes' to 'high priority items' indicates a significant gap between what was delivered (analysis) and what was expected (identified issues with clear prioritization or direct fixes). The error count and lack of apparent resolution suggest the investigation didn't yield the actionable insights needed.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User pivoted from analysis to implementation, requesting fixes to 'high priority items' - indicating they either wanted actionable recommendations with clear prioritization or expected the agent to proceed directly to fixes.",
