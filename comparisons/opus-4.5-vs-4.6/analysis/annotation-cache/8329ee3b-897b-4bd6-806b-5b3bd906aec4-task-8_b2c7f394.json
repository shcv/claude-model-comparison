  "summary": "The agent correctly identified the user's questions about firmware diagnostics and provided relevant research, but misaligned with the user's underlying need for direct assistance obtaining and installing firmware. The follow-up request revealed the user expected actionable help rather than informational guidance, and the agent's failure to act on the download request suggests it encountered a limitation (likely inability to download from the specific firmware source) without clearly communicating this constraint to the user.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User immediately requested a concrete action (firmware download) after receiving informational content, suggesting they wanted hands-on help rather than just research.",
