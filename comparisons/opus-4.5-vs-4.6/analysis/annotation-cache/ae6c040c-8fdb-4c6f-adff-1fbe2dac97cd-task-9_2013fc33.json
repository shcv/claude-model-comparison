  "summary": "The agent performed focused refactoring work to qualify message names in a Rust codebase as requested, executing multiple search and edit operations with persistent problem-solving despite 13 encountered errors. The incomplete nature of the task (partial completion) and lack of user feedback suggests either the work was sufficient for the user's immediate needs or the session ended before verification. The significant error count and iteration required indicate the agent struggled with some aspects of the refactoring but ultimately recovered and made meaningful edits.",
