  "summary": "The agent demonstrated strong autonomy in systematically exploring the codebase and breaking down a multi-part UI requirement into actionable tasks, making targeted edits to implement the changes. However, the session ended with a context-limit continuation message rather than user confirmation, and the partial completion status suggests the work was interrupted before full verification or the final implementation detail for item-location mapping was fully addressed. The agent maintained focus on the three specific requirements without scope creep, though alignment is moderate due to incomplete feedback on whether all aspects (particularly the item display across referenced locations) were fully implemented.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User provided a continuation message indicating the session was resumed from a previous conversation that ran out of context, suggesting the agent's work was sufficient to carry forward but implementation may not have been fully verified before context ran out.",
