The immediate follow-up with more specific questions suggests the user did not receive the codebase analysis they expected, requiring significant iteration to complete this exploratory work.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User immediately followed up with a more specific, detailed request for code walkthrough (setup, initialization, config, usage examples). This suggests either the first response was insufficient or the user is systematically working through understanding the codebase in incremental steps.",
