The user is now proposing enhanced logging as a diagnostic tool, indicating they want better visibility into WebSocket behavior rather than confirmation that the previous fix worked. This represents a shift toward debugging methodology rather than acceptance of the prior work.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is proposing a new debugging approach (adding WebSocket logging to Flutter logs) to gain visibility into the problem. This suggests the initial fix either didn't work or didn't address the root cause, and the user is pivoting to better observability.",
