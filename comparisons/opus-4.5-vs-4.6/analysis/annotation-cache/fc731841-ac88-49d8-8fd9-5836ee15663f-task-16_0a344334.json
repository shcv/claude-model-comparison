  "summary": "The agent successfully completed the requested data update and process planning tasks with no technical errors and good execution. However, the user's follow-up indicates the planning methodology missed an important distinction between autonomous behavior and user-directed subagent usage\u2014suggesting the agent didn't fully internalize the nuanced evaluation framework the user wanted to establish. This is refinement feedback rather than dissatisfaction, indicating the foundation was solid but needed better contextual understanding.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is providing clarification on evaluation criteria and distinguishing between two usage modes (autonomous vs user-directed), suggesting they want the process refined to account for these differences in future iterations.",
