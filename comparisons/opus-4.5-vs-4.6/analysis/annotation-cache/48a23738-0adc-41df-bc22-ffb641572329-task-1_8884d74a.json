While this is a reasonable approach for complex diagnosis, the user's immediate follow-up about certificate verification suggests the investigation did not fully address their original concerns about whether an email was sent and where it might be stored. The shift to a security verification task indicates either incomplete findings or a blocking issue that emerged.",
