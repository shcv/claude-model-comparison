  "summary": "The agent continued a complex refactoring task from a previous session, working autonomously through multiple file modifications, error recovery, and investigation across 17 files with 89 tool calls over ~18 minutes. While the agent demonstrated good error recovery and methodical approach, the high error count (27), significant iteration required, and session termination without explicit completion indicate the work was interrupted or stalled before full resolution of the refactoring objectives.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "Expected continuation of the refactoring work in a new session, given the previous conversation summary indicates ongoing implementation. User may resume with feedback on progress or pivot to a new aspect of the same project.",
