  "summary": "The agent conducted a methodical hardware detection investigation using appropriate Linux tools but failed to identify the actual fingerprint sensor hardware, likely because it didn't know to look for integrated power button sensors specifically. The user's follow-up suggests the agent's search strategy was misaligned with the actual hardware configuration, requiring course correction and further investigation with better search parameters.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User provided a technical correction/hint that the power button itself is the fingerprint reader, suggesting the agent's search approach may have looked in wrong places or used wrong search terms.",
