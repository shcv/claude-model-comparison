While the approach was methodical and autonomous, encountering 13 errors during execution (likely from grep/file operations) suggests the task wasn't fully successful, and the lack of user follow-up is ambiguous\u2014possibly indicating completion but more likely indicating the user moved on or wasn't satisfied with the partial results.",
