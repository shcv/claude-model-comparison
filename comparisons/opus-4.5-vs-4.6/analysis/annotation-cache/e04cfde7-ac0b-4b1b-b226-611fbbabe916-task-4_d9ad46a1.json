While the initial question was straightforward (asking about rounding behavior), the agent provided no tool usage, code analysis, or investigation. The user's immediate follow-up demanding verification and detailed results indicates the response was inadequate, requiring the agent to actually examine the forms and scripts to provide concrete evidence-based answers.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User escalated expectation level by requesting verification and detailed walkthrough, indicating the initial response was insufficient. This suggests the agent either didn't address the question adequately or the user wanted hands-on investigation of the code.",
