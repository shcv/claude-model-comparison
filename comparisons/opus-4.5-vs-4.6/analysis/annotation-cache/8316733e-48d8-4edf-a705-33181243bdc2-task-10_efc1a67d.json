  "summary": "The agent executed a thorough plan refinement process with user engagement through AskUserQuestion, explored the codebase, and proposed a detailed implementation strategy in plan mode. However, the user's immediate pivot to a different approach (Claude API script for categorization) suggests the refined plan didn't align with their actual intent, indicating a significant gap in understanding the desired solution despite clear communication of the proposed approach.",
