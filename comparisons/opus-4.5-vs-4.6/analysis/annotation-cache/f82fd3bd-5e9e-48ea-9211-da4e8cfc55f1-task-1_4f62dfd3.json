The user's redirect to a new question about binary management suggests the original investigation didn't meet their actual information need, indicating poor alignment between the task executed and the task intended.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User abandoned the original question and asked a new, more practical question about binary version management and changelog tracking. This suggests either the investigation wasn't helpful enough to pursue, or the user decided to move toward a more actionable concern.",
