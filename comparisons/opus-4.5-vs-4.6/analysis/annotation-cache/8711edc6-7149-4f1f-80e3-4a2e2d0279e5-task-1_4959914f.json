  "summary": "Agent provided solid debugging support for a Python package installation issue, using systematic verification, documentation lookup, and targeted edits to resolve runtime errors. Work was focused and methodical, though the empty final user message suggests either successful resolution (and user moving on) or incomplete verification of the fix. Minor misalignment: agent should have confirmed whether the fix resolved the original error before session ended.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "Empty next_user_message after session_end suggests either the issue was resolved to user's satisfaction or the user moved on. Most likely scenario: user tested the fix and it worked, so no follow-up was needed.",
