  "summary": "The agent engaged in thorough investigation of the codebase and diff file using multiple search and read operations to understand the changelog context. However, the work appears to have been interrupted before a final changelog output was delivered to the user. The high number of read/grep operations (60 calls) relative to actual output (no writes) suggests significant analysis was performed, but completion status remains ambiguous.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The session terminated without a follow-up message from the user. It's unclear if the user received a satisfactory changelog or if they abandoned the task. The empty next_user_message combined with session_end suggests either satisfaction with an initial response or premature session termination.",
