  "summary": "The agent executed the initial request to add methods to the peach interface with multiple protocol IDs, but the follow-up message reveals fundamental misunderstanding of what 'is_complete' should measure. The user's clarification\u2014that completion should be evaluated against a 'what' line formula rather than state tracking\u2014indicates the implementation needs significant rework. This represents a typical early-stage iteration where the user's actual requirements differ from their initial description.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user will likely need the agent to rework the 'is_complete' logic to evaluate whether the 'what' line conditions are satisfied rather than tracking completion state directly. This suggests the agent will need to parse/implement a logical formula from the protocol definition.",
