  "summary": "The agent conducted exploratory analysis of translation heuristics and string handling, using grep and file operations to investigate the codebase. However, the work appears to have been only partially aligned with what the user wanted\u2014they quickly pivoted to a new request for comparative analysis (A vs B), suggesting the prior investigation may not have fully addressed their core need. The agent handled errors during execution but would have benefited from clearer clarification of intent earlier.",
