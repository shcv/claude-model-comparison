The interaction suggests the user expected guidance on implementation strategy, but the agent's response was minimal, leaving the actual work unaddressed and requiring significant further iteration to resolve the user's questions.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is asking for implementation guidance on two related questions: (1) using subagents to load and check items instead of defaults, and (2) best practices for promoting glossary entries to distinct files as they grow. These suggest continued iteration on a larger feature or documentation system.",
