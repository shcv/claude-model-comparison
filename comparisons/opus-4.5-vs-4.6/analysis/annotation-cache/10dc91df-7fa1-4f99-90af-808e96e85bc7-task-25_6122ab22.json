  "summary": "Agent attempted to implement three related improvements to caching/progress UI behavior, but encountered multiple edit errors and struggled with error recovery, requiring bash verification instead of clean edits. The user's message was incomplete (cut off mid-sentence), making it difficult to assess whether the agent fully understood the requirements, particularly the nuanced expectations around progress bar thresholds and size consistency. The session ended without confirmation that the work matched the user's intent.",
