  "summary": "The agent conducted a structural investigation using bash but didn't uncover insights that matched what the user actually needed. The user's follow-up shows they wanted a more targeted approach starting from a specific version with concrete changes (mL support, category structure verification), not a broad structural comparison. The misalignment suggests the agent should have asked clarifying questions about the user's actual goal before running exploration commands.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User reset to a concrete, step-by-step approach: start with the 1955 version, add mL support, and verify/correct the beverages/soda category structure. This suggests the previous exploration was too broad and the user needed to guide the work more directly.",
