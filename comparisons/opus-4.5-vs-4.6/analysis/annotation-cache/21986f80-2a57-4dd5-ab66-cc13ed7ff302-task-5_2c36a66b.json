  "user_sentiment": "Engaged but unclear/frustrated. The user's initial message trails off mid-thought, and their follow-up requests 'more detailed proposals,' suggesting they felt the initial response was incomplete or insufficiently detailed.",

The agent successfully navigated the codebase and identified relevant files, but the user's message cuts off mid-sentence, suggesting the interaction may have been interrupted or the agent didn't fully address the underlying question about why removing Approve_item affects Request_item.",

  "summary": "The agent performed competent codebase exploration but failed to deeply engage with the user's core design question about task sequencing in the protocol system. The user's incomplete initial message and follow-up request for 'more detailed proposals' indicates dissatisfaction with the depth of analysis provided. The agent needed to ask clarifying questions or offer concrete design proposals rather than just reading files.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is asking for deeper analysis and specific proposals with detailed rules for generating variants. This suggests the agent's initial exploration was surface-level and didn't provide the actionable design guidance the user needed.",
