  "user_sentiment": "Appears positive but focused on moving forward. The follow-up message starts with 'let's reorganize' suggesting acceptance of the investigation phase and eagerness to proceed to refactoring work.",

The agent read multiple files, used grep to search for relevant patterns, and ran commands to understand the codebase structure, but did not produce the requested diagram or comprehensive explanation before the user moved to the next phase.",

  "summary": "The agent conducted a thorough investigation of the codebase structure by systematically reading files and running diagnostic commands to understand the architecture, but did not deliver the requested explanation and diagram before the user moved to the next task. While the investigation work was well-executed and apparently sufficient for the user's immediate needs, the task was technically incomplete in terms of deliverables, resulting in partial alignment with the original request.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User interrupted the explanation/diagramming phase and pivoted to the next requested task: reorganizing the architecture variants and making the demo script configurable. This is typical when investigation is sufficient for the user's purposes even if formal deliverables weren't completed.",
