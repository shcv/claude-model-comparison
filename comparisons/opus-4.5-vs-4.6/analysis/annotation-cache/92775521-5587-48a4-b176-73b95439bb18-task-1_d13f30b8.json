  "summary": "The agent attempted to read the protocol file to fix sayso parameter mismatches but encountered an access error that prevented task completion. While the agent demonstrated focused scope and clear file-reading intent, it failed to recover from or adequately explain the error, resulting in unmet primary objectives. The user's follow-up request suggests they may not have received the response explaining the failure, or they chose to proceed with a secondary request despite the primary task not being completed.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The 'also' prefix indicates the user is adding a secondary request (alternative names for monotonic-ucp) rather than expressing dissatisfaction with the first part. However, the lack of confirmation that the main task was completed suggests either the user didn't notice the error or is moving forward pragmatically.",
