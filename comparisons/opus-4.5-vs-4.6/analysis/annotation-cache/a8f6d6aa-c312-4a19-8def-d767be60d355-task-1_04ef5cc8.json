  "summary": "The agent appropriately began structuring a CV revision strategy based on the user's role transition goals, but failed to anticipate that the user's statement about 'not sure those projects should be highlighted' was a critical concern requiring research before proceeding. The user's next message reveals they wanted exploratory work on project relevance as a prerequisite step, not immediate CV drafting. This represents a significant misalignment on task sequencing and priorities.",
