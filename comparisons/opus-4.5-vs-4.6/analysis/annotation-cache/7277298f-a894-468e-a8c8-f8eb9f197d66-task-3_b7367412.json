  "summary": "Agent successfully entered planning mode and scaffolded a web dashboard architecture with API documentation, but appears to have overemphasized the demo/dashboard component relative to the protocol documentation interface that the user actually wanted. User's follow-up clarification mid-sentence suggests partial misalignment on whether this should be a generic web viewer or a protocol-specific documentation system. Good recovery and planning discipline, but initial scope reading missed the protocol documentation-first intent.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is narrowing focus from a general web dashboard to emphasizing protocol documentation as a core feature of the adapter layer. Expects continued refinement of the API/documentation interface rather than full feature implementation.",
