When the user attempted to proceed with their actual goal (installing the APK), they hit a different error (missing split APK), indicating the prior work may have missed the root cause or there were other blockers the agent didn't anticipate. The user's follow-up suggests significant misalignment between what the agent fixed and what was actually needed.",
