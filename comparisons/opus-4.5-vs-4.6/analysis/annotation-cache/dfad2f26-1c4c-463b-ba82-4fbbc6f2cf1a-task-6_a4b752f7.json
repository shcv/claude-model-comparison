  "summary": "The user gave a minimal 'ok' prompt which resulted in an agent running for over 5 minutes before being asked to kill the process. The work itself is uncharacterizable due to minimal context, but the rapid termination request and 3 errors encountered suggest significant misalignment between what the user expected and what the agent actually did. The interaction lacks clarity about the original intent.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User terminated the running task with 'kill it', suggesting the task was either taking too long, producing unwanted output, or had unclear purpose. This may have been a test of agent behavior or an immediate regret about initiating the task.",
