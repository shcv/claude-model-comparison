However, the work appears incomplete as the user's next message indicates they expected or wanted the agent to also handle force-pushing the git history, suggesting the agent may have stopped short of the full remediation the user intended.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User asked for a destructive git operation (force-push), indicating the agent's initial fix was accepted and the user wanted the history cleaned up. This is a natural progression from fix \u2192 cleanup.",
