  "summary": "The agent entered plan mode to address the user's two specific issues (path identification and message filtering), but struggled during implementation with repeated edit errors (8 errors across 8 edits). While the planning phase appeared sound, the execution phase suggests the refactoring proved more complex than anticipated. The session ended without clear resolution, leaving partial completion of the requested improvements.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "With no follow-up message and session_end, the user likely either: (1) found the work satisfactory and moved to implementation themselves, or (2) abandoned the session due to iterative correction burden. The high error count suggests potential frustration.",
