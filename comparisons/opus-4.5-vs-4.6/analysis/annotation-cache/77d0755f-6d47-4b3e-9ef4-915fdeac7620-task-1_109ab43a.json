  "summary": "The agent independently researched the feasibility of porting the Claude binary to OpenBSD through web searches and local binary analysis, gathering relevant technical context about Bun's architecture and cross-compilation constraints. However, the investigation remained exploratory rather than conclusive, providing research context but not definitive answers about actual porting difficulty or viability. The lack of user follow-up suggests the exploratory approach may have partially satisfied the request, though more concrete technical assessment or next steps would have strengthened the response.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "Empty follow-up suggests either satisfaction with the investigative approach or indifference to the findings. User may have gotten what they needed for independent evaluation, or may have decided the question was premature before receiving concrete answers.",
