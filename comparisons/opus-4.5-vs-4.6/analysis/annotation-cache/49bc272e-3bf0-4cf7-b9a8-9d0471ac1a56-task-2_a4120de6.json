  "summary": "The agent proactively improved the Guix home configuration by fixing potential module import and error handling issues, demonstrating good technical judgment. However, without explicit user feedback or verification that the changes solved the stated stability problem, it's unclear if the improvements directly addressed the user's core concern or if they were general hardening measures. The task was technically sound but the alignment with the actual stability issue is uncertain.",
