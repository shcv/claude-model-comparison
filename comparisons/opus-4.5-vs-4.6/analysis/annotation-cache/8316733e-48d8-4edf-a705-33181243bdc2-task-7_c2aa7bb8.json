However, the analysis encountered technical issues that prevented clear results, and the user's follow-up request for 'both' approaches suggests the initial analysis was incomplete or unclear, requiring further iteration to properly address the user's underlying intent.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User asked agent to execute two parallel approaches ('do both'), indicating the prior analysis may have been inconclusive or the user wanted multiple perspectives. The brief follow-up suggests the user was engaged but possibly waiting for clearer results.",
