  "summary": "The agent acted decisively on the user's suggestion to integrate an SDK, researching documentation and making targeted code updates without requiring clarification. While there were edit errors during execution that were recovered from, the work was completed in a single interaction. The empty follow-up message suggests either satisfaction with the outcome or that the user moved on, indicating reasonable alignment with intent though not perfect clarity on full requirements.",
