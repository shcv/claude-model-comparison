  "summary": "The agent attempted a trial-and-error approach to APK downloading using Bash commands, but all attempts failed without producing useful results or insights. The user's follow-up reveals the agent missed critical context about Shorebird release patching and the technical requirements involved, indicating fundamental misalignment with what the user actually needed\u2014informed guidance on whether local rebuilding is feasible with Shorebird's constraints, not command experimentation.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User rejected the approach and asked clarifying questions about whether local rebuilding with Shorebird would work, what additional tooling is needed, and why APK downloading requires extra setup. This suggests the user expected the agent to understand the Shorebird ecosystem and provide informed guidance rather than blind troubleshooting attempts.",
