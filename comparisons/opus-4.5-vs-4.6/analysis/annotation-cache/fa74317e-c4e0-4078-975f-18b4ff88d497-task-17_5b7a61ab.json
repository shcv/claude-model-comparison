  "user_sentiment": "Neutral to slightly negative. The empty next_user_message with session_end categorization combined with 6 errors and no explicit approval indicates the user likely stopped due to context limits or frustration rather than satisfaction.",

  "summary": "The agent showed high autonomy in resuming context-heavy refactoring work but struggled with execution quality, producing 6 errors across 7 edits that suggest incomplete fix validation. While the agent remained focused on the stated objectives (security, validation, SDK abstraction), the high error rate and lack of explicit user approval at session end indicate the work was incomplete or required rework, necessitating continuation in a new context window.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "Expected continuation of the same task in a new session, potentially with the user reviewing prior work, identifying which fixes actually succeeded, and redirecting the agent toward more careful or focused implementation.",
