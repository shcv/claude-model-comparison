  "summary": "The agent appropriately delegated codebase exploration to a specialized Explore agent for comprehensive analysis. However, no explicit summary or findings were presented to the user in the visible output, making it unclear what insights were actually delivered. The user's follow-up question suggests they obtained enough context to formulate specific technical questions, but the partial visibility into the investigation results and lack of explicit deliverable creates a misalignment with typical expectations for this type of discovery task.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User pivoted from general investigation to specific technical deep-dive on DHT algorithms and scaling. This suggests the investigation was sufficient to contextualize the project but the user wants to move directly into design discussion and problem-solving.",
