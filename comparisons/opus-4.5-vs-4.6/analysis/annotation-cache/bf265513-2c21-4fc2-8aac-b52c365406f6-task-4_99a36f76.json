  "summary": "The agent autonomously completed the requested README update and configuration check, but made a substantive error by including the SDK as a pip dependency when it should not be listed as an external requirement (since it's likely a self-reference or not meant to be installed via pip). The user's clarifying follow-up indicates the work requires revision, suggesting the agent didn't fully understand the project's dependency model before making changes.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is clarifying the correct configuration rather than approving the work. This suggests a correction cycle where the agent needs to re-examine and fix the requirements list based on the user's clarification that SDK should not be listed as an external requirement.",
