  "summary": "The agent successfully completed the architecture analysis and generated multiple TikZ diagram files as requested. Despite one error during execution (recovered), the agent delivered standalone diagrams suitable for paper inclusion. The absence of follow-up communication suggests acceptable output quality, though the user may have needed to review the technical artifacts offline before determining full satisfaction.",
