The agent's work was incomplete and unclear, failing to properly execute either the original or new request, resulting in poor alignment with user intent and requiring further iteration.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User added a continuation task ('also update local dev') rather than affirming completion, suggesting the prior work may not have been fully visible or satisfactory. This indicates normal iteration where additional requirements emerge.",
