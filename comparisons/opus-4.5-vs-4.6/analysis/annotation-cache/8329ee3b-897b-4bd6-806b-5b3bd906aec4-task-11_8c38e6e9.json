  "summary": "The agent attempted network diagnostics work as requested but encountered a connectivity error ('no route to host') that prevented completing the WAN-side exploration. The user's follow-up message indicates the approach failed, requiring troubleshooting of the underlying connectivity issue rather than continuation of the original strategy. Alignment was low because the agent didn't successfully address the user's actual need, which appears to be resolving a network connectivity problem.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is reporting a concrete error ('no route'), likely wanting the agent to either troubleshoot the root cause or adjust approach. This suggests the previous attempt failed and iteration is needed.",
