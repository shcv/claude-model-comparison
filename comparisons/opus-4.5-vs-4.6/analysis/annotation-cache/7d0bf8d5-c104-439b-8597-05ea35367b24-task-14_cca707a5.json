  "summary": "The agent successfully implemented the requested drag-and-drop UI improvements by replacing the drop-here zone with an Add Location button and adding line-style drop targets between categories. The user's follow-up indicates satisfaction with the core implementation and is now requesting a spacing refinement, which is typical iteration. The 3 edit errors during implementation suggest the agent had to make corrections but ultimately delivered working code that the user is building upon.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user is requesting a refinement to the spacing behavior of drop targets during drag operations, indicating they're iterating on the feature they just received. This is typical post-implementation fine-tuning.",
