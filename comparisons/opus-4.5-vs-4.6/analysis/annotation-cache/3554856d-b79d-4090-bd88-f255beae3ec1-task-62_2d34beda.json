  "summary": "The agent invested considerable effort investigating cjdns installation and setup but failed to achieve the core objective of running a node and observing routing statistics. While exploratory work was thorough, 7 errors encountered and inability to complete the actual network run indicates a significant gap between user intent and execution outcome. The user's follow-up question suggests frustration that the primary goal remained unmet.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is probing why the original goal (observing routing label statistics on a running network) was not achieved. Likely expects follow-up troubleshooting or acknowledgment of blocking issues.",
