The follow-up message indicates the user will handle configuration setup and expects the agent to adjust the implementation accordingly, requiring further iteration to fully satisfy the intent.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user indicated they will handle the home config setup themselves and asked the agent to fix the current implementation (likely to remove or adjust the placeholder/alias reference now that the user has clarified the final approach).",
