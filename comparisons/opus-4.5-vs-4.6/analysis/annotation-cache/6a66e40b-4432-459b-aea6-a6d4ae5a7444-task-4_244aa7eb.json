Despite the incomplete work, the user moved decisively to option C and requested protocol fixes, suggesting the analysis may have provided enough clarity for decision-making or the user had already leaned toward that direction. The agent's reliance on subagent delegation for what could have been direct file reading and analysis was not optimal for this focused investigation task.",
