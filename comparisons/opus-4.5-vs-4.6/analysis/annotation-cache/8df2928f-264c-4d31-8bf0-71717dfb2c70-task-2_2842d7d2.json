  "summary": "The agent executed a multi-file redesign task with good structural changes (enum expansion, density mapping, component updates) and high autonomy, but implemented the visual feedback for density levels in a way that didn't fully match the user's mental model. The user's 'very close' feedback indicates the foundation is correct but refinements are needed around visual presentation (removing percentage text, adding padding indicators via lines, clarifying font size behavior).",
