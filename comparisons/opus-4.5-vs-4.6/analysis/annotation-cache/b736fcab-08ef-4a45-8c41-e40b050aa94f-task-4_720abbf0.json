  "summary": "The agent made steady progress on the requested filtering and action-blocking features, implementing changes across filter logic and action handlers. However, multiple edit conflicts and test failures (5 errors encountered) consumed significant effort in debugging and recovery. The session was cut off mid-continuation, making it unclear whether the final implementation satisfied all requirements or whether the user approved the changes.",
