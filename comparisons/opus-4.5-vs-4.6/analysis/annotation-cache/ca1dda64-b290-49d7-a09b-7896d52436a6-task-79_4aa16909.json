  "summary": "The agent successfully implemented openwakeword integration by selecting user-specified ideas from prior context and making targeted code modifications. While the implementation was solid and the user accepted it (evidenced by the follow-up request for a simple adjustment), the 6 editing errors and need for multiple edits suggest there may have been minor friction or miscommunication in translating the user's implicit requirements into correct code changes. The user's immediate follow-up demonstrates engagement and satisfaction with the direction.",
