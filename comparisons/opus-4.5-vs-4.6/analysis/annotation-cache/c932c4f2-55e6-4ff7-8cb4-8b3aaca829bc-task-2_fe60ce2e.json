  "summary": "The agent successfully implemented a comprehensive onboarding flow with configuration detection and initialization logic, staying focused on the specified plan without over-engineering. The user's immediate follow-up request to add keybindings support indicates satisfaction with the foundation, though the 8 editing errors suggest the implementation could have been slightly more straightforward. Overall, the agent demonstrated good autonomy and delivered working code that matched the user's core intent.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is satisfied enough to ask for additional features (keybindings support), indicating the initial implementation met expectations and they want to build on it.",
