  "summary": "Agent successfully implemented the async compiler message routing refinement by modifying the _action_recipients function to check attribute matches at the action level rather than role level. The work was systematic and error-correcting, with the user indicating completion via 'commit this' request. Minor misalignment possible in whether the implementation fully matched the intended scope, but execution was sound.",
