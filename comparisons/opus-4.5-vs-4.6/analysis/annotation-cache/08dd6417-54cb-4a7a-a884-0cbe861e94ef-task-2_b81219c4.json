  "summary": "The agent attempted to follow up on a fragmentary request about investigating Claude Code source files and IDE integration, but struggled with missing directories and incomplete context. When errors accumulated, the user redirected to 'Phase 1', indicating the investigation approach may have missed the actual intent or was taking too long. The low alignment score reflects that the agent's exploratory work didn't align with what the user actually needed next.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User pivoted away from the investigation with 'yes, start with Phase 1', suggesting either impatience with the investigative approach or that investigation was preparatory context.",
