  "summary": "The agent successfully analyzed both scripts and consolidated version calculation logic by moving distribute.sh to the scripts directory with unified approach, staying focused on the user's stated goal. The task was interrupted by a permission request rather than user dissatisfaction, with the agent demonstrating good problem-solving in identifying and resolving code duplication. Minor misalignment potential exists around whether the refactoring fully matched the user's intended scope versus their preferred solution approach.",
