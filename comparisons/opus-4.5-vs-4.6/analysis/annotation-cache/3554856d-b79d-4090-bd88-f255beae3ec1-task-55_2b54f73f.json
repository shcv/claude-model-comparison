  "summary": "User engaged in exploratory discussion about onion routing design, presenting ideas without requesting implementation. The agent took no actions during this interaction, making it primarily a conversational exchange. The lack of tools used and zero files touched suggests the agent may have provided discussion without active problem-solving, resulting in partial alignment with what might have been valuable architectural guidance.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User appears to be converging on a solution (nested packets as mechanism for longer routes). Would expect either code implementation of this approach or further architectural discussion.",
