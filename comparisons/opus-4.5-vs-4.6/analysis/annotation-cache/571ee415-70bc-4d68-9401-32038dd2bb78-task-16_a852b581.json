However, the implementation had two critical functional bugs (weakened wakeword detection and broken re-listening behavior) that were only discovered during user testing, indicating insufficient validation before completion and requiring significant follow-up iteration to fix.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User reported two specific bugs: (1) wakeword detection is weaker in always-on mode compared to test mode, (2) the system sends messages without re-listening afterwards. These indicate the feature was partially broken, leading to troubleshooting.",
