  "summary": "The agent conducted focused research into sigstore vendoring requirements and demonstrated good investigative approach, but the conversation was interrupted before delivering complete analysis. The user's follow-up shows they expected actionable license findings to inform an architectural decision (two-version approach), indicating the agent partially aligned with intent but didn't fully anticipate the licensing constraint as a primary concern from the start.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User introduced a new constraint (non-free software rejection) and asked for license analysis of marginal dependencies, with intention to create two versions (Guix-compatible and full). Expects continuation of analysis with license-specific findings.",
