  "summary": "The agent conducted a focused investigation into Claude Code's session management, systematically searching through the codebase with appropriate tools. While the exploration was thorough and stayed on-task, the user's silence at completion and the moderate number of errors encountered suggest the investigation may not have fully answered the user's specific questions about session index tracking and .claude directory replacement behavior. The partial task completion and lack of clear findings indicates some misalignment with what the user ultimately needed.",
