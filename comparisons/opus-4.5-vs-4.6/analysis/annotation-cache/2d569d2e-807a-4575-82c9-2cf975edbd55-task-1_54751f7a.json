It then began implementation by setting up test infrastructure, but the session ended before completion. The plan and initial scaffolding appear well-aligned with the user's intent, though the partial implementation and lack of feedback creates some uncertainty about whether this represents satisfactory progress or incomplete work.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User ended session without feedback, suggesting either approval of the plan and initial setup, or intention to continue work independently. The empty message may indicate the plan was sufficient without requiring implementation completion in this session.",
