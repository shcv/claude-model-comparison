  "summary": "This was a brief informational exchange rather than a work task. The user asked a clarification question about SSH key specification, and the agent did not respond (0 tool calls, 0 files touched). The user then provided context that the key is on 'bacon,' suggesting they are gathering information before proceeding with actual work. Alignment is moderate because without a visible agent response, it's unclear whether the agent acknowledged or addressed the initial question.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is providing contextual information about their infrastructure setup. This appears to be part of a larger conversation about connecting to or using the 'bacon' server, with the user clarifying that the necessary SSH key is already in place there.",
