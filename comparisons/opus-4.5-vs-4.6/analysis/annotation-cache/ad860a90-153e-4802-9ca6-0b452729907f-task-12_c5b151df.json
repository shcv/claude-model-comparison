  "summary": "The agent provided a reasonable starting point by enabling async reading in the Lieer config, but only partially addressed the user's multi-part request. The user's follow-up shows they wanted concrete progress on archiving strategies and notmuch optimization, not just exploratory troubleshooting. The agent stayed focused on the immediate technical issue but missed the opportunity to discuss implementation of the two stated goals (archiving + more frequent indexing).",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user continued the conversation with clarifications about archive channels and explicit requests for two new concrete actions: local mail archiving (older than ~1 year) and more frequent notmuch index updates. This suggests the prior response addressed symptoms but not root causes.",
