However, the user's immediate follow-up question about merging Guix Home with GNU Stow suggests the initial implementation plan may have missed the broader architectural goal of unified config management, requiring significant redesign before proceeding with actual implementation.",

This suggests iteration on the design phase rather than rejection of the prior work.",
