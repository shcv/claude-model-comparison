The user's follow-up clarifies they want conditional caching logic based on whether a key was present, indicating the initial implementation missed the nuanced caching requirements and will need further refinement.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is providing clarification on desired caching behavior (remember builds unless explicitly refreshed, but recheck if using fallback), indicating they want the agent to modify the cache invalidation logic to be more intelligent about when to rebuild.",
