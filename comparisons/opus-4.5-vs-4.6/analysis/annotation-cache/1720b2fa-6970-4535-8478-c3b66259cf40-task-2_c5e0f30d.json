  "summary": "The agent performed a focused exploratory analysis of consensus semantics and implementation details as requested, reading relevant code files and identifying concerns. However, the user's incomplete follow-up message suggests the agent may not have identified or articulated the specific issue the user was concerned about (the synchronous finalization assumption and priority conflicts), resulting in partial alignment with the underlying intent. Significant iteration appears necessary to resolve the user's actual concern.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User was mid-thought in their correction/clarification about synchronous assumptions in the instant executor and appears to have been either cut off or decided to revise their message. Likely expects the agent to help verify synchronization guarantees or identify the specific edge case being hinted at.",
