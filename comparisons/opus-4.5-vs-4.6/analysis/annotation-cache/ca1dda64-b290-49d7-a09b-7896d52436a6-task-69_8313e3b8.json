  "user_sentiment": "Positive but interrupted mid-task. User provided a follow-up request that appears to be a new task using the 'Tool: claude' invocation (suggesting the naming change worked), indicating satisfaction with prior work but shifting focus.",
  "sentiment_confidence": "high",
  "execution_quality": "Good execution with clear understanding of requirements. Agent read existing configuration, made targeted edits to add tool descriptions and implement requested naming changes, and verified changes with bash commands. Some trial-and-error in finding exact configuration structure but recovered smoothly.",

Agent reviewed tool configuration data structure, edited configuration files to add descriptions and rename the claude tool, and set up hooks for message presentation.",

  "summary": "Agent successfully addressed both configuration questions about tool descriptions and the tool renaming/hook setup request for Claude Code SDK integration. Work was focused and well-executed, though the user's next message indicates they're moving on to a new task rather than confirming completion of refinements, suggesting minor gaps in closure or hook implementation details that may need verification.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User pivoted to a new task using the claude tool they just had configured, requesting a project summary via git history and directory review. This suggests the configuration work was successful and the agent should now execute this new analytical task.",
