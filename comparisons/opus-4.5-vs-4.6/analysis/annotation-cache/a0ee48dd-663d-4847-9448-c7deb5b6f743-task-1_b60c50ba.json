  "summary": "The agent successfully completed a codebase investigation task to understand existing memory system documentation, recovering from search errors to locate relevant files and notes. The user's follow-up request to create new documentation suggests they were satisfied with the investigation but now want specific implementation work that represents a natural next step.",
