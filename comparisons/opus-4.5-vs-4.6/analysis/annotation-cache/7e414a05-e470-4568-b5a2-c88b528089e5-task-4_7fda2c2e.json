  "summary": "Agent implemented the core design of the Peach event system following the provided plan, setting up classes and logic for reaction handling and enablement bridging. However, the high error count during editing and the user's immediate request for rechecking and investigating testing issues suggests the implementation had correctness or integration problems that weren't caught. The work was appropriately scoped but execution quality was undermined by implementation difficulties, resulting in partial rather than confident completion.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User explicitly requested verification work and delegated investigation of a testing issue to a subagent, suggesting they wanted confirmation of correctness before moving forward or integrating changes.",
