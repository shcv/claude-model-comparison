However, the user's follow-up question about inhibiting while watching YouTube suggests they may not have fully understood how to use the implemented solution or there may be a gap between the intended behavior and what was delivered. The work was competent but the conceptual alignment between the implementation and the user's actual workflow needs may not be complete.",
