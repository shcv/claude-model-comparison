  "summary": "The agent successfully implemented the optional unbound parameter feature with good autonomy and error recovery. While the execution was sound, the user's pivot to requesting detailed explanation suggests they may want to verify understanding of the implementation flow before validating it as correct. The 4-point alignment reflects effective task completion with minor uncertainty about whether the implementation fully matched the user's technical vision.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User shifted from implementation mode to comprehension mode, asking for detailed technical explanation of the enabled calculation flow. This suggests either validating the implementation or planning next steps based on understanding.",
