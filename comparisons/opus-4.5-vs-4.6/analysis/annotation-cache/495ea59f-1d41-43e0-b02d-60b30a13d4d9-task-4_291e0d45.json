  "summary": "Agent successfully completed a substantial four-part refactoring task with systematic methodology and strong error recovery. The work involved implementing feasibility semantics, removing unused code paths, renaming variables for consistency, and rewriting example code to use the full multiagent system. Minor misalignment possible around completeness of feasibility implementation or testing verification, but overall execution was thorough and well-managed.",
