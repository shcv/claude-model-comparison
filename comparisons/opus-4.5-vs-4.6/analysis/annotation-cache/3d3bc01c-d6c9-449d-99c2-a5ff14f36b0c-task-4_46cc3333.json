The user then moved forward independently with a different task (batch interval configuration). This represents a missed opportunity for clarification that would have benefited the design discussion.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User proceeded independently with a configuration task after the naming question appeared unresolved. This suggests either the user decided to move forward without the agent's input, or the agent's response was deemed unhelpful.",
