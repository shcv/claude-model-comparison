  "summary": "Agent executed the first phase of a multi-phase conformance testing expansion plan, generating 85 fixture files and establishing test infrastructure with high autonomy. While the request was cut off mid-sentence, the agent correctly inferred the intent and systematically created categorical expected outputs for existing test fixtures. The work appears substantially complete for Phase 1, though the subsequent user silence leaves minor uncertainty about whether all generated outputs matched exact specifications.",
