  "summary": "The agent successfully completed the requested documentation task by analyzing the codebase and creating a CLAUDE.md file with build commands, testing procedures, and architecture overview. The user's immediate pivot to debugging suggests the documentation was useful, but possible launch issues in the codebase may have warranted a mention during analysis. Overall a well-executed single-pass task with minor room for deeper vetting of the codebase's operational status.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user invoked /iterate to begin debugging and fixing runtime problems, indicating a shift from documentation to active troubleshooting work.",
