The user's follow-up question indicates they needed to understand the version update mechanism, suggesting the initial work lacked context or explanation. The partial completion and shift to a clarifying question suggests misalignment between what the user needed (understanding the system) versus what was delivered (mechanical tagging).",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User shifted from action-oriented request (tag commits) to knowledge-seeking (understand versioning logic). This indicates they may want to understand the system before or after tagging, or verify the tagging was done correctly based on the actual logic.",
