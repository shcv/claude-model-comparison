  "summary": "The agent continued work on an incomplete implementation task, methodically using search and edit tools to make targeted code changes. While execution was competent and focused, the vague continuation requests and partial completion suggest unclear task boundaries or that the work spanned multiple conceptual phases. The low communication of what was accomplished and lack of clear next steps indicate potential misalignment with the user's ultimate goal.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The agent likely continued working on the task after the second 'continue' message, suggesting iterative progress through a larger implementation. The pattern indicates the user was monitoring work and asking for continuation.",
