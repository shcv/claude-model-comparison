  "summary": "Agent successfully implemented three feature requests for a voice control system (mute/unmute keybinding, noise buffering with duration threshold, silent activation guard) with systematic debugging and error recovery. User's immediate follow-up with additional related questions suggests good alignment with their intent, though minor execution friction (4 edit errors) prevented perfect alignment. The work was focused and appropriately scoped to the stated requirements.",
