  "summary": "The agent understood the user's intent to spawn multiple validation subagents and began executing the task with 6 tool calls targeting spec file validation. However, the user interrupted before the task could complete, and 6 errors were encountered during execution, suggesting technical issues with the subagent spawning approach. The interruption prevents clear assessment of whether the agent's orchestration strategy matched the user's actual needs.",
