The user's follow-up indicates the issue involves variable-size source-routed packets with port-dependent encoding, requiring deeper technical understanding. The work was competent but incomplete, needing revision based on the user's clarification.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user is providing additional technical context (source-routed packets with variable-size hop labels and port-dependent bit widths) to guide the agent toward a more accurate understanding. This suggests the user will expect the agent to revise its explanation or analysis based on this new information.",
