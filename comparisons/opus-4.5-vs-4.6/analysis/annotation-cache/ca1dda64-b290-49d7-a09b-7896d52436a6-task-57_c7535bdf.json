  "user_sentiment": "Mixed frustration and exploratory curiosity. The user acknowledges some progress (faster response) but reports continued problems (choppy output, no text display). The follow-up question suggests they're investigating a separate but related hardware issue rather than expecting the previous edits to fully solve the problem.",

The user's pivot to investigating hardware driver issues indicates recognition that the software modifications alone were insufficient, and further debugging or different approach is needed.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user shifted focus to investigating a hardware-specific issue with the UMC202HD audio interface and Linux driver behavior (mono mic input being mixed across channels). This suggests either dissatisfaction with the software approach or recognition that hardware-level issues need addressing first.",
