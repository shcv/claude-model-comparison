The user's follow-up reveals a deeper technical constraint (minification making ID-based patterns fragile) that wasn't fully addressed, and they're now pivoting toward an alternative approach using non-mangled patterns. The agent's exploration provided useful context but didn't reach the actual problem-solving phase the user wanted to discuss.",
