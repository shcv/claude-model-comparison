  "summary": "The agent began implementing a detailed plan for sliding tab animations in Flutter but made only partial progress, encountering multiple edit errors that weren't fully resolved before the user redirected to a git rebase task. The gap between the comprehensive plan provided and the incomplete implementation suggests the agent struggled with either scope management or execution reliability, resulting in significant misalignment with the user's original intent.",
