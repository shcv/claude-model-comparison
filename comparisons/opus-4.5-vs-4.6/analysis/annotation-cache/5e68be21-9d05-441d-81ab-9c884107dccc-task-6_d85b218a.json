  "summary": "The agent made incremental improvements to visible feedback but missed the core architectural issue the user identified: the narrator wasn't properly configured to orchestrate multi-agent interactions. The user's follow-up clarifies that the real problem is the narrator's system prompt lacks instructions for coordinating responses and presenting them back to the user as unified turns, indicating the initial approach addressed symptoms rather than root causes.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is providing clarifying guidance on the narrator's role and responsibilities. Expected next iteration would involve rewriting the narrator's system prompt to include clear instructions about requesting clarification, collating agent responses, and presenting results as cohesive turns.",
