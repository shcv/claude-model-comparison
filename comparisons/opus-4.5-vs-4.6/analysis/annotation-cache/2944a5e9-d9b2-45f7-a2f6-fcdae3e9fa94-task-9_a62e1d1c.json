  "summary": "The agent relayed audit findings but did not execute the cleanup and file management work that the user then requested in their follow-up message. While the communication was clear and task coordination appropriate, the agent appears to have only passed along information rather than taking autonomous action on the data pipeline work, requiring the user to provide additional direction for the actual cleanup and renaming tasks.",
