  "summary": "Agent performed a straightforward filesystem check in response to a clarifying question, but the next message reveals the user's actual intent was broader: establishing a pattern for archive directory references across the codebase with semantic distinctions. The agent's initial work was relevant but incomplete relative to the user's actual need. The low alignment score reflects this gap between the narrow task performed and the wider architectural concern the user was raising.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User redirected the agent toward a different goal: pointing directory references toward archive directories while distinguishing between different archive types (moving emails vs other archive semantics).",
