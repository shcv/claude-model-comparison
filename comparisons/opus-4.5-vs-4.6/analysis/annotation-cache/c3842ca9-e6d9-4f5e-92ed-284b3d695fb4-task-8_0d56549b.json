  "summary": "Agent successfully completed a license compliance investigation by delegating research to a subagent and examining relevant packaging files. The work was appropriately scoped and execution was competent, though user's immediate pivot to a new task suggests either the initial findings were exactly what was needed or the research could have been more conclusive. Minor misalignment: user asked for dependency license analysis but agent focused on investigation approach rather than delivering a clear summary of findings before the user moved forward.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User immediately pivoted to a new implementation task (update packaging without patches), indicating the initial research was sufficient for decision-making. New request suggests user is ready to move forward based on findings.",
