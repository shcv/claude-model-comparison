The user's follow-up question revealed a misalignment in approach, requiring course correction. The agent demonstrated good research skills but missed the implicit user intent to work at a higher abstraction level.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user's question 'shouldn't we just use their sdk?' indicates they expected SDK usage rather than raw API implementation. This likely triggered a course correction where the agent pivoted to using the SDK.",
