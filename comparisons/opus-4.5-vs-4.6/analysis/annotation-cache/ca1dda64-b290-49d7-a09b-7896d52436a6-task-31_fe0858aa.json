  "summary": "Agent attempted to debug a Click CLI traceback in the eris project through targeted code analysis and edits, but the task was cut short when the user switched contexts to a home configuration task. The editing errors encountered (5 total) suggest some friction in the implementation, though the agent recovered and continued working. Without visibility into whether the original bug was actually fixed, task completion remains ambiguous.",
