The agent's focused, minimal approach was appropriate, but lack of confirmation or error details left the actual resolution unclear. Significant iteration would be needed to verify the fix and address the follow-up feature requests.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User moved directly from the error context to describing separate UI/UX issues with the enactment feature, suggesting they either resolved the error independently or decided it wasn't blocking progress. This is typical iteration on a live project.",
