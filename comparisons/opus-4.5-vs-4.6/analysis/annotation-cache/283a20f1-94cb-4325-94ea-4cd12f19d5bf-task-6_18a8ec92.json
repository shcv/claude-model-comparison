While the code changes were technically competent and test failures were debugged and fixed, the user's immediate follow-up indicates the design didn't match their actual intent\u2014they wanted a simpler approach without the parenthesized notation. The misalignment suggests the agent interpreted the requirement too literally without validating the approach first.",
