  "summary": "The agent performed substantive exploratory and editing work on a data collection task, executing methodically across multiple files with good technical execution but was interrupted mid-session when the user's laptop died. The agent's work appears partially aligned with the user's stated goal, though the lack of clear completion or user verification before interruption leaves some ambiguity about whether the intended outcome was fully achieved. The user's request to resume suggests they expect to continue from the prior state rather than restart.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is asking the agent to resume from the interrupted state. This implies the prior work was either incomplete or the user wants to verify/continue from where it left off rather than start fresh.",
