  "summary": "The agent correctly interpreted the user's request to use subagents for rule investigation and began orchestrating the work by creating a task delegation structure. However, the session was cut short before substantive analysis of individual rules could occur, leaving the actual verification work incomplete. The conversation continuation in a new session suggests the user was still working toward the original goal but needed to restart due to context limitations.",
