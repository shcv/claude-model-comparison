The user's immediate follow-up with a concrete feature request suggests the initial research phase missed the mark or didn't provide sufficient clarity to proceed, leading to a refocus on implementation rather than continued exploration.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User reframed the request into a concrete implementation task with specific features (search, pagination, detail toggling). This suggests the initial research didn't fully address what was needed, prompting the user to move directly to feature specification.",
