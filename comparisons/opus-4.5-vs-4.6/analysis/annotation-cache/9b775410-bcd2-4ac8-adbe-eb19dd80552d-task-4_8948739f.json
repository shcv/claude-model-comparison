The user's follow-up indicates they recognize the direction is sound but the execution needs methodological refinement before continuing\u2014this is iteration rather than failure, with the agent needing to restructure the analysis to define metrics/motivations before applying them.",

They expect the agent to revise the approach to establish clearer evaluation criteria first.",
