  "summary": "The agent created a reasonable file structure matching the refactoring plan but left significant gaps in implementation that became apparent during testing. The user's immediate follow-up with /iterate suggests they recognized incomplete work and wanted systematic validation and fixing rather than a fresh start, indicating partial but directional progress toward the goal.",
