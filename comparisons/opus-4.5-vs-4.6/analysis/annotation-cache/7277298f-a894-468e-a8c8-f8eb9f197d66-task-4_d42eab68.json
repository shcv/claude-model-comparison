  "summary": "Agent successfully implemented protocol documentation and UI editing features by creating new endpoints, schemas, and frontend components across multiple files. Work was well-organized and logically sequenced with good error recovery. Minor alignment gap: agent focused heavily on implementation details while user may have wanted quicker feedback on architectural feasibility, though end result appears to meet stated requirements given the immediate follow-up request.",
