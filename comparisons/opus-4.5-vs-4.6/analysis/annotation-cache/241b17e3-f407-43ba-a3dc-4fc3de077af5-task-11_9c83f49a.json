  "summary": "Agent made substantive progress implementing a coordination protocol for the cc-mas multi-agent system, creating new specification files and running validation scripts. While 17 errors occurred during the session, the agent recovered from each and maintained forward momentum on the core task. The session ended abruptly without user feedback, making it unclear whether the agent had completed the intended scope or ran out of context before reaching the desired endpoint.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "Session ended without explicit follow-up. Empty next_user_message combined with session_end outcome suggests either task completion leading to natural break, or user context limit forcing session end.",
