  "summary": "The agent took the initiative to expand analysis dimensions and prepare report generation in org-mode format, working independently with multiple read-edit cycles to refine the script. Execution was interrupted mid-task, but the agent's approach and incremental modifications suggest good alignment with user intent, with only minor misalignment around completion visibility.",
