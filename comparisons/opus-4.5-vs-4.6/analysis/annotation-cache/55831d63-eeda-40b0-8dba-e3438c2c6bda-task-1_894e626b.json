While the planning was thorough and the user's follow-up request suggests implicit approval, the agent did not formally exit plan mode or receive explicit user confirmation before the session moved to the next phase. The work aligned well with the user's intent to set up a benchmark system, though the handoff between planning and execution could have been more explicit.",
