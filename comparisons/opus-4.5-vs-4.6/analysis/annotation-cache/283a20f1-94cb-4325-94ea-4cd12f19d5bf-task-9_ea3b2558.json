  "summary": "The agent successfully implemented the single-line parameter constraint as requested, executing the work cleanly with no errors and appropriate verification. The follow-up request for tests suggests the user was satisfied with the implementation but the slight scope interpretation (not pre-emptively adding tests) represents minor misalignment with what might have been expected as complete work.",
