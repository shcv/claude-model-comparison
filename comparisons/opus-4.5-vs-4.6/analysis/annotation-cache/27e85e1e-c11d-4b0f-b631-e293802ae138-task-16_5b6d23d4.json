However, the user's request was truncated mid-sentence ('Or where the leader is an orchestrator with...'), leaving core requirements unstated. The subsequent empty user message suggests either dissatisfaction, a connection issue, or that the agent's work didn't address what the user actually needed despite reasonable effort to interpret the incomplete request.",
