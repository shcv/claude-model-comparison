  "summary": "The agent successfully completed the requested code modifications for smart mode dormant state switching with clean execution and no errors. The user's follow-up messages indicate general satisfaction but reveal three additional items: missing observability for web search tool calls, need for a microphone mute/unmute keybinding, and concerns about false positives from ambient noise. The user appears engaged and iterating on the feature rather than expressing dissatisfaction with the prior work.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User is continuing the conversation with three distinct follow-up items: a bug/feature observation about missing web search tool logs, a feature request for microphone mute/unmute keybinding, and an incomplete thought about accidental activation from ambient noise.",
