  "summary": "Agent independently designed and implemented a multi-component UI system for protocol configuration with good architectural decisions and clear code organization. However, a fundamental misunderstanding about parameter binding scope resulted in incorrect cross-enactment parameter sharing, which the user immediately identified. The agent needs to adjust the parameter prefilling logic to respect enactment boundaries, indicating the initial implementation missed a key requirement despite overall structural alignment.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User provided targeted technical correction for parameter binding scope. Expected follow-up: agent fixes the parameter scoping logic to isolate bindings within individual enactments only.",
