  "summary": "The agent successfully entered plan mode to redesign the bridge architecture into two systems: a type-checking middleware for peach and a separate sync/proxy system. Despite 10 errors encountered (likely permission requests), the agent recovered well, clarified requirements through targeted questions, and delivered a comprehensive implementation plan with file structure, component responsibilities, and integration approach. The session ended cleanly with an unfinished user message, suggesting natural workflow interruption rather than dissatisfaction.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "Session ended without explicit feedback. User likely satisfied with the plan and ready to proceed with implementation, or temporarily stepping away to review the generated plan document.",
