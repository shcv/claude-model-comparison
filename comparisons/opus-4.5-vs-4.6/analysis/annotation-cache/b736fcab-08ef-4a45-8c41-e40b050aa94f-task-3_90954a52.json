  "summary": "Agent made solid progress on a complex feature (async enablement-driven action construction) by planning thoroughly and implementing the core mechanics. However, the incomplete initial request and 14 edit errors suggest the implementation may not have fully captured the user's intent. The user's follow-up introduces additional constraints (non-key value filtering, pending action blocking) that weren't in the initial request, indicating either missed requirements or incomplete specification handoff. The engagement level and technical follow-up questions suggest the agent was on a reasonable track but needs further refinement to meet full requirements.",
