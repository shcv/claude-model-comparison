  "summary": "The agent conducted a detailed investigation of the user's configuration files to recommend an SSH agent setup approach, demonstrating good autonomy and systematic exploration. However, the user's follow-up question suggests the agent may have missed or overlooked the user's existing pinentry setup, indicating a misalignment between the agent's recommendations and the user's actual needs or constraints. The task requires iteration with a different direction.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "The user redirected the task: instead of implementing the agent's recommendations, they asked for integration with existing Guix home configs and questioned whether pinentry (which they already have working) wouldn't be suitable. This indicates they want a different solution path.",
