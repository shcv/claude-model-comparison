  "summary": "The agent successfully created a script with the requested dry-run and manual execution features, demonstrating good autonomy and focused scope management. However, the follow-up message reveals a gap between the user's implicit expectation (preventing redownloads of partially archived emails) and what the script delivered, requiring significant iteration to add deduplication logic. The work was well-executed for the stated request but didn't fully anticipate the real-world problem.",
  "follow_up_pattern": "User identified a gap in the implementation (redownloading non-archived items) and requested deduplication logic to prevent it. This suggests the script worked as written but didn't fully solve the underlying problem, requiring iteration.",
