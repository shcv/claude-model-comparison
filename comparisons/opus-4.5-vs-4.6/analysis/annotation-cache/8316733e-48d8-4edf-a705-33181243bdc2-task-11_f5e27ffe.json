  "summary": "Agent successfully implemented a Claude API script solution that met the user's specific request for categorizing candidate notes incrementally. The approach demonstrated good judgment by testing on a moderate sample first before full processing, and the user's request to 'wait for the rest' indicates confidence in the solution. The work stayed focused on the stated goal without unnecessary additions.",
