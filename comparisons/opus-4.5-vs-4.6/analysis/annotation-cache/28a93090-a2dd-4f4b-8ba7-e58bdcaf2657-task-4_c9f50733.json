  "summary": "The agent successfully implemented improvements to autonomy attribute handling by reading the codebase systematically, planning the changes with TodoWrite, making targeted edits to enforce binding consistency and automatic sender binding, and validating with testing. While 13 errors occurred during editing and validation, the agent recovered from each through methodical debugging. The clean transition to a new task suggests the work met the user's expectations, though minor misalignment may exist in implementation details not fully reviewed in the final output.",
