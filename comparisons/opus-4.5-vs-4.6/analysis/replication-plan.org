#+TITLE: Model Replication Plan
#+DATE: 2026-02-04

* Overview

This plan identifies tasks with known repository states that can be replicated
with different models for direct comparison.

* Replication Candidates

** Task 1: cc-summarize Summary Redesign (OPUS 4.5)

- Task ID :: 72465ca0-a202-4f3c-9a81-69d9133ff153-task-12
- Model :: Opus 4.5
- Type :: investigation/complex
- Prompt :: "the summary feature doesn't work; rewrite it to use the code implemented for --summarize. Redesign the system, with several different kinds of summaries..."

*** Original Metrics
| Metric    | Value |
|-----------+-------|
| Tools     |    28 |
| Files     |     2 |
| Lines     |  +323 |
| Duration  |  246s |
| Outcome   | new_task |

*** Repository State
- Repo :: ~/projects/cc-summarize
- Start commit :: 84ca308 (fix: isolate --summary sessions from user's Claude history)
- End commit :: 0cfeca7 (refactor: redesign --summary to use Summarizer class)

*** Replication Steps
1. git worktree add /tmp/cc-summarize-repl 84ca308
2. cd /tmp/cc-summarize-repl
3. Run with target model (opus-4-6 if comparing to opus-4-5 original)
4. Record metrics

** Task 2: Interruptions Cascading Stress Test (OPUS 4.6)

- Task ID :: 27e85e1e-c11d-4b0f-b631-e293802ae138-task-2
- Model :: Opus 4.6
- Type :: greenfield/complex
- Prompt :: "Implement the following plan: # Cascading Interrupts Stress Test..."

*** Original Metrics
| Metric    | Value |
|-----------+-------|
| Tools     |    21 |
| Files     |     7 |
| Lines     | +1618 |
| Duration  |   N/A |
| Outcome   | new_task |

*** Repository State
- Repo :: ~/projects/interruptions
- Start commit :: EMPTY (greenfield - repo didn't exist)
- End commit :: 57f41b5 (Initial commit)

*** Replication Steps
1. mkdir /tmp/interruptions-repl && cd /tmp/interruptions-repl
2. git init
3. Run with opus-4-5 model
4. Record metrics

** Task 3: Go Hook Binary + TCP (OPUS 4.6)

- Task ID :: f3365352-6d5a-4095-9a31-b29f1cf3893c-task-2
- Model :: Opus 4.6
- Type :: port/complex
- Prompt :: "Implement the following plan: # Plan: Go hook binary + TCP support..."

*** Original Metrics
| Metric    | Value |
|-----------+-------|
| Tools     |    59 |
| Files     |    12 |
| Lines     |  +701 |
| Duration  | 227.4s |
| Outcome   | new_task |

*** Repository State
- Repo :: ~/projects/claude-coder
- Start commit :: (need to find parent of first commit in session)
- Status :: Need to verify commit exists

** Task 4: Music Playback Bugfix (OPUS 4.6)

- Task ID :: 5bc09504-d3ad-4863-be77-b0d46a6cb6aa-task-2
- Model :: Opus 4.6
- Type :: bugfix/complex
- Prompt :: "Implement the following plan: # Plan: Fix Music Playback + Audio Settings Page..."

*** Original Metrics
| Metric    | Value |
|-----------+-------|
| Tools     |    48 |
| Files     |     7 |
| Lines     |  +663 |
| Duration  |   N/A |
| Outcome   | new_task |

*** Repository State
- Repo :: ~/projects/claude-coder
- Start commit :: (need to find)
- Status :: Need to verify commit exists

* Priority Order

1. *Interruptions Stress Test* - Cleanest replication (greenfield, start from empty)
2. *cc-summarize Redesign* - Verified commits exist
3. *Go Hook Binary* - Need to verify commit state
4. *Music Bugfix* - Need to verify commit state

* Comparison Goals

After replication, compare:
1. Tool count and efficiency (tools per 100 lines)
2. Files touched (same as original?)
3. Duration
4. Outcome (does it work?)
5. Code quality (subjective review)
