  "classification": "iterative_development",
  "confidence": "high",
  "reasoning": "Task B introduces a new, independent feature (replacing config button with edit mode toggle) rather than fixing problems from Task A; the overlap is incidental as both tasks work on the same screen components, and the user's prompt focuses on a new requirement rather than referencing issues with Task A's output."
